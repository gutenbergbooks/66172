Like</span> every other specific collection of art labour among
the several such brought together within these splendid
halls of the South Kensington Museum, this extensive
one made from woven stuffs, tapestry, and needlework, is
meant to have, like them, its own peculiar useful purposes.
Here, at a glance, may be read the history of the loom of various
times and in many lands. Here may be seen a proof of the onward
march of trade and its consequent civilizing influences. Here we take a
peep at the private female life in ages gone by, and learn how women,
high-born and lowly, spent or rather ennobled many a day of life in
needlework, not merely graceful but artistic. Here, in fine, in strict
accordance with the intended industrial purposes of this public institution,
artizans, designers, and workers in all kinds of embroidery, may gather
many an useful lesson for their respective crafts, in the rare as well as
beautiful samples set out before them.</p>

<p>The materials out of which the articles in this collection were woven,
are severally wool, hemp, flax, cotton, silk, gold, and silver. The silken
textures are in general wholly so; in many instances they are wrought
up along with either cotton, or with flax; hence, in ancient documents,
the distinction of “holosericum,” all silk, and “subsericum,” not all silk,
or the warp&mdash;that is, the longitudinal threads&mdash;of cotton or flax, and the
woof&mdash;that is the cross-threads of silk. Very seldom is the gold or the
gilt silver woven into these textiles found upon them in a solid wire-drawn
form, but almost always, after being flattened very thin, the
precious metal was wound about a very small twist of cotton, or of flax,
and thus became what we call gold thread. As a substitute for this, the
Moors of Granada, and after them the Spaniards of that kingdom,
employed strips of gilded parchment, as we shall have to notice.</p>

Under</span> its widest acceptation, the word “textile” means
every kind of stuff, no matter its material, wrought in the
loom. Hence, whether the threads be spun from the produce
of the animal, vegetable, or the mineral kingdom&mdash;whether
of sheep’s wool, goats’ hair, camels’ wool, or camels’ hair&mdash;whether
of flax, hemp, mallow, Spanish broom, the filaments drawn out
of the leaves of the yucca&mdash;Adam’s needle&mdash;and other plants of the lily
and asphodel tribes of flowers, the fibrous coating about pods, or cotton;
whether of the mineral amianthus, of gold, silver, or of any other metal,
it signifies nothing, the webs from such materials are textiles. Unlike
to these are other appliances for garment-making in many countries; and
of such materials, not the least curious, if not odd to our ideas, is paper,
which is so much employed for the purpose by the Japanese.</p>

<p>At the outset of our subject a word or two may be of good use, upon</p>

<h3><i>The Geography of the Raw Materials</i>.</h3>

<p>one or other of which we shall always find wrought up in the textiles in
this collection. We will then begin with</p>

<h4 id="wool"><span class="smcap">Wool</span>.</h4>

<p>After gleaning out of the writings of the ancients all they have said
about the physical geography of the earth, as far as their knowledge of it
went, and casting our eyes upon a map of the world as known of old,
we shall see at once the materials which man had at hand, in every
clime, for making his articles of dress.</p>

<p>In all the colder regions the well-furred skins of several families of
beasts could, by the ready help of a thorn for a needle, and the animal’s
own sinews for thread, be fashioned, after a manner, into the requisites
of dress.</p>

<p>Throughout by far the longest length and the widest breadth of the
earth, sheep, at an early period, were bred, not so much for food as for
raiment. At first, the locks of wool torn away from the animal’s back
by brambles, were gathered: afterwards shearing was thought of and
followed in some countries, while in others the wool was not cut off, but
plucked by the hand away from the living creature, as we learn from
Pliny:<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> “Oves non ubique tondentur: durat quibusdam in locis vellendi
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</span>
mos.” Got in either method the fleeces were, from the earliest
times, spun by women from the distaff. At last so wishful were the
growers to improve the coats of their lambs that they clothed them
in skins; a process which not only fined the staple of the wool, but kept
it clean, and better fitted it for being washed and dyed, as we are told by
many ancient writers, such as Horace and the great agricultural authority
Varro. In uttering his wish for a sweet peaceful home in his old age,
either at Tibur, or on the banks of the pleasant Gelæsus, thus sings the
poet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Dulce pellitis ovibus Gelæsi</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Flumen.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And what were these “oves pellitæ,” or “tectæ” and “molles,” as they
were called, in contradistinction to “hirtæ,” we understand from Varro,
who says, “oves pellitæ; quæ propter lanæ bonitatem, ut sunt Taren-tinæ
et Atticæ, pellibus integuntur, ne lana inquinetur quo minus vel
infici rectè possit, vel lavari ac parari.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>This latter very ancient daily work followed by women of all degrees,
spinning from off the distaff, was taught to our Anglo-Saxon
sisters among all ranks of life, from the king’s daughter downwards. In
his life of Eadward the elder, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 901, Malmesbury writes: “Filias
suas ita instituerat ut literis omnes in infantia maxime vacarent, mox
etiam colum et acum exercere consuescerent, ut his artibus pudice impubem
virginitatem transigerent.”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The same occupation is even now a
female favourite in many countries on the Continent, particularly so all
through Italy. Long ago it bestowed the name of spindle-tree on the
Euonymus plant, on account of the good spindles which its wood affords,
and originated the term “spinster,” yet to be found in our law-books as
meaning an unmarried woman even of the gentlest blood, while every
now and then from the graves that held the ashes of our sisters of the
British and the Anglo-Saxon epochs, are picked up the elaborately ornamented
leaden whorls which they fastened at the lower end of their
spindles to give them a due weight and steadiness as they twirled them
round.</p>

<p>Beginning with the British islands on the west, and going eastward on
a line running through the Mediterranean sea, and stretching itself out far
into Asia, we find that the peoples who dwelt to the north of such a
boundary wrought several of their garments out of sheep’s wool, goats’
hair, and beavers’ fur, while those living to the south, including the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</span>
inhabitants of North Africa, Arabia, and Persia, besides the above-named
animal produce, employed for these purposes, as well as tent-making, the
wool and hair which their camels gave them: the Baptist’s garment was
of the very coarsest kind.</p>

<p>Of the use of woollen stuff, not woven but plaited, among the older
stock of the Britons, a curious instance was very lately brought to light
while cutting through an early Celtic grave-hill or barrow in Yorkshire:
the dead body had been wrapped, as was shown by the few unrotted
shreds still cleaving to its bones, in a woollen shroud of coarse and loose
fabric wrought by the plaiting process without a loom.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>As time crept on, it brought along with it the loom, fashioned though
it was after its simplest form, to the far west, and taught its use throughout
the British islands. The art of dyeing very soon followed; and so
beautiful were the tints which our Britons knew how to give to their
wools, that strangers, while they wondered at, were not a little jealous of
the splendour of those tones. From the heavy stress laid upon the rule
which taught that the official colour in their dress assigned to each of the
three ranks into which the bardic order was distinguished, must be of
one simple unbroken shade, whether spotless white, symbolic of sun-light
and holiness, for the druid or priest&mdash;whether sky-blue, emblem of peace,
for the bard or poet&mdash;or green, the livery of the wood and field, for the
Ovydd or teacher of natural history and leech-craft, yet at the same
moment we know that party-coloured stuffs were woven here, and after
two forms: the postulants asking leave to be admitted into bardism might
be recognized by the robe barred with stripes of white, blue, and green,
which they had to wear during all the term of their initiation. With
regard to the bulk of our people, according to the Greek historian of
Rome&mdash;Dion Cassius, born <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 155&mdash;the garments worn by them
were made of a texture wrought in a square pattern of several colours;
and speaking of our brave-hearted British queen, Boadicea, that same
writer tells us that she usually had on, under her cloak, a motley tunic,
χιτὼν παμποίκιλος, that is, checkered all over with many colours. This
garment we are fairly warranted in deeming to have been a native stuff,
woven of worsted after a pattern in tints and design exactly like one or
other of the present Scotch plaids. Pliny, who seems to have gathered a
great deal of his natural history from scraps of hearsay, most likely included
these ancient sorts of British textiles along with those from Gaul,
when he wrote:&mdash;“Plurimis vero liciis texere quæ polymita appellant,
Alexandria instituit: scutullis dividere, Gallia.” But to weave with a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</span>
good number of threads, so as to work the cloths called polymita, was
first taught in Alexandria; to divide by checks, in Gaul.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The native botanical home of</p>

<h4 id="cotton"><span class="smcap">Cotton</span></h4>

<p>is in the East. India almost everywhere throughout her wide-spread
countries, and many kingdoms of old, arrayed, as she still arrays herself, in
cotton, which she gathered from a plant of the mallow family, that had
its wild growth there; and in this same vegetable produce the lower

orders of the people dwelling still further to the east were fain to clothe
themselves.</p>

<h4 id="hemp"><span class="smcap">Hemp</span>,</h4>

<p>a plant of the nettle tribe, and called by botanists “cannabis sativa,”
was of old well known in the far north of Germany, and all over
the ancient Scandinavia. Full two thousand five hundred years ago,
Herodotus<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> thus wrote of it: “Hemp grows in the country of the
Scythians, which except in the thickness and height of the stalk, very
much resembles flax; in the qualities mentioned, however, the hemp is
much superior. It grows in a wild state, and is also cultivated. The
Thracians make clothing of it very like linen cloth; nor could any
person, without being very well acquainted with the substance, say whether
this clothing is made of hemp or flax.” From “cannabis,” its
name in Latin, have we taken our own word “canvas,” to mean any
texture woven of hempen thread.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">[7]</a> Herod. book iv. 74.</p>

</div>

<h4 id="flax"><span class="smcap">Flax</span></h4>

<p>now follows. Who that has ever seen growing a patch of beautiless,
sad-looking hemp, and as he wandered a few steps further, came upon a
field of flax all in flower, with its gracefully-drooped head, strewing the
breeze, as it strayed over it, with its frail, light-blue petals, could at first
have thought that both these plants were about to yield such kindred
helps for man in his wide variety of wants? Yet so it is. Besides many
other countries, all over this our native land flax is to be found growing
wild. Though every summer its handsome bloom must have caught the
eye of our Celtic British forefathers, they were not aware for ages of the
use of this plant for clothing purposes, else had they left behind them some
shred of linen in one or other of their many graves; since, following, as
they did, the usage of being buried in the best of the garments they were
accustomed to, or most loved when alive, their bodies would have been
found arrayed in some small article of linen texture, had they ever worn
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</span>
such. That at length they became acquainted with its usefulness, and
learned to prepare and spin it, is certain; and in all likelihood the very
name “lin-white thread,” which those Celts gave it in its wrought shape,
furnished the Greeks with their word λίνον, and the Latins their <i>linum</i>,
for linen. The term “flax,” which we still keep, from the Anglo-Saxon
tongue, for the plant itself and its raw material, and the Celtic
“linen,” for the same vegetable produce when spun and woven into
cloth, are words for things akin in our present language, which, as in
many such like instances, show the footprints of those races that, one
after another, have trod this land.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To the valley of the Nile must we go if we wish to learn the earliest
history of the finest flaxen textiles. Time out of mind were the Egyptians
famous as well for the growth of flax, as for the beautiful very fine linen
they wove out of it, and which became to them a most profitable, because
so widely sought for, article of commerce. Their own word, “byssus,”
for the plant itself, became among the Greeks, and afterwards among the
Latin nations, the term for linens wrought in Egyptian looms. Long
before the oldest book in the world was written, the tillers of the ground
all over Egypt had been heedful in sowing their flax, and anxious about
its harvest. It was one of their staple crops, and hence was it that, in
punishment of their hard-hearted Pharaoh, the hail plague which, at the
bidding of Moses, showered down from heaven, hurt throughout the
land the flax just as it was getting ripe.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Though the Jordan grew flax
upon its banks, and all over the land that would soon belong to Abraham’s
children, the women there, like Rahab, carefully dried it when
pulled, and stacked it for future hackling upon the roofs of their houses;<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
still, it was from Egypt, as Solomon hints,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> that the Jews had to draw
their fine linen. At a later period, among the woes foretold to Egypt,
the prophet Isaiah warns her that they shall be confounded who wrought
(there) in combing and weaving fine linen.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>How far the reputation of Egyptian workmanship in the craft of the
loom had spread abroad is shown us by the way in which, beside sacred,
heathenish antiquity has spoken of it. Herodotus says:&mdash;“Amasis King
of Egypt gave to the Minerva of Lindus, a linen corslet well worthy of
inspection,”<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and further on,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> telling of another corslet which Amasis
had sent the Lacedæmonians, observes that it was of linen, and had
a vast number of figures of animals inwoven into its fabric, and was
likewise embroidered with gold and tree-wool. What is more worthy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</span>
of admiration in it is that each of the twists, although of fine texture,
contains within it 360 threads, all of them clearly visible.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> By these
trustworthy evidences we clearly see that in those early times, Egypt was
not only widely known for its delicately woven byssus, but it supplied
all the neighbouring nations with the finest sort of linens.</p>

<p>From written let us now go to material proofs at hand. During late
years many mummies have been brought to this country from Egypt, and
the narrow bandages with which they were found to have been so admirably,
even according to our modern requirements of chirurgical fitness,
so artistically swathed, have been unwrapped; and always have they been
so fine in their texture as to fully verify the praises of old bestowed upon
the beauty of the Egyptian loom-work. Moreover, from those who have
taken a nearer and, so to say, a trade-like insight into such an article of
manufacture, we learn that, “The finest piece of mummy-cloth, sent to
England by Mr. Salt, and now in the British Museum, of linen, appears
to be made of yarns of near 100 hanks in the pound, with 140 threads
in an inch in the warp and about 64 in the woof.”<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Another piece of
linen which the same distinguished traveller obtained at Thebes, has 152
threads in the warp, and 71 in the woof.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Here starts up a curious question. Though, from all antiquity upwards
till within some few years back, the unbroken belief had been that
such mummy-clothing was undoubtedly made of linen woven out of pure
unmixed flax, some writers led, or rather misled, by a few stray words in
Herodotus about tree-wool, while speaking of the corslet of Amasis,
quoted just now, took at once the expression of that historian to mean
wool, and then skipped to the conclusion that all Egyptian textiles
wrought a thousand years before were mixed with cotton. When, however,
it be borne in mind that even several hundred years after the Greek
historian wrote, the common belief existed that, like cotton, silk also was
the growth of a tree, as we are told by Virgil:</p>

</div>

<p>the εἰρίοισι ἀπὸ ξυλοῦ of Herodotus may be understood to mean silk, just
as well as cotton; nay, the rather so, as it seems very likely that, at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</span>
time when Amasis lived, silk, in the shape of thread, had found, through
traders’ hands, its way to the markets of Egypt, and must have been
thought a more fitting thing, from being a new as well as costly material,
to grace a royal gift to a religious sanctuary of high repute, than the less
precious and more common cotton. While this question was agitated,
specimens of mummy-cloth were submitted to the judgment of several
persons in the weaving trade deemed most competent to speak upon the
matter. Helped only by the fingers’ feel and the naked eye, some among
them agreed that such textures were really woven of cotton. This
opinion was but shortlived. Other individuals, more philosophical, went
to work on a better path. In the first place, they clearly learned,
through the microscope, the exact and never-varying physical structure
of both these vegetable substances. That of cotton they found
in its ultimate fibre to be a transparent tube without joints, flattened so
that its inward surfaces are in contact along its axis, and also twisted
spirally round its axis; that of flax, a transparent tube, jointed like a cane,
and not flattened or twisted spirally.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Examined in the same way, several
old samples of byssus or mummy-bandages from Egypt in every one
instance were ascertained to be of fine unmixed flaxen linen. Ages
before French Flanders had dreamed of weaving fine lawns, ages before
one of her industrial cities&mdash;Cambray&mdash;had so far taken the lead as to be
allowed to bestow her own name, in the shape of “cambric,” on the
finest kind that modern European ingenuity could produce, Egypt had
known how to give to the world even a yet finer sort, and centuries
after she had fallen away from her place among the kingdoms of the
earth, her enthralled people still kept up their ancient superiority in spinning
and weaving their fine, sometimes transparent, byssus, of which a
specimen or two may be seen in this collection.

<p>For many reasons the history of</p>

<h4 id="silk"><span class="smcap">Silk</span></h4>

<p>is not only curious, but highly interesting. In the early ages, its very
existence was quite unknown, and when found out, the knowledge of it
stole forth from the far east, and straggled westward very very slowly.
For all that lengthened period during which their remarkable civilization
lasted, the older Egyptians never once beheld silk: neither they, nor the
Israelites, nor any other of the most ancient kingdoms of the earth, knew
of it in any shape, either as a simple twist, or as a woven stuff. Not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</span>
the smallest shred of silk has hitherto been found in the tombs, or amid
the ruins of the Pharaonic period.</p>

<p>No where does Holy Writ, old or new, tell anything of silk but in
one single place, the Apocalypse, xviii. 12. True it is that, in the
English authorized version, we read of “silk” as if spoken of by Ezekiel,
xvi. 10, 13; and again, in Proverbs, xxxi. 22; yet there can be
no doubt, but that in both these passages, the word silk is wrong through
the translators misunderstanding the original Hebrew משי (meschi). Of
this word, Parkhurst says: “As a noun, משי, according to our translation
(is) silk, but not so rendered in any of the ancient versions. <i>Silk</i> would
indeed well enough answer the ideal meaning of the Hebrew word,
from its being <i>drawn forth</i> from the bowels of the silk-worm, and that to
a degree of fineness, so as to form very slender threads. But I meet
with no evidence that the Israelites in very early times (and to these
Ezekiel refers) had any knowledge of <i>silk</i>, much less of the manner in
which it was formed; משי, therefore, I think, means some kind of <i>fine
linen</i> or <i>cotton cloth</i>, so denominated from the <i>fineness</i> with which the
threads whereof it consisted were <i>drawn out</i>. The Vulgate, by rendering
it in the former passage, ‘subtilibus’ <i>fine</i>, as opposed to <i>coarse</i>, has
nearly preserved the true idea of the Hebrew.”<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Braunius, too, no mean
authority, after bestowing a great deal of study on the matter, gives it
as his well-weighed judgment that, throughout the whole Hebrew Bible,
no mention whatever can be found of silk, which was a material utterly
unknown to the children of Israel.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Once only is silk spoken of in the
New Testament, and then while St. John<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> is reckoning it up along with
the gold, and silver, and precious stones, and pearls, and fine linen&mdash;byssus&mdash;and
purple which, with many other costly freights merchants were
wont to bring in ships to that mighty city which, in the Apostle’s days,
ruled over the kings of the earth.</p>

<p>Long after the days of Ezekiel was it that silk, in its raw form only,
made up into hanks, first found its way to Egypt, western Asia, and
eastern Europe.</p>

<p>To Aristotle do we owe the earliest notice, among the ancients, of
the silk-worm, and although his account be incorrect, it has much value,
since, along with his description, the celebrated Greek philosopher gives
us information about the original importation of raw silk into the western
world. Brought from China, through India, till it reached the Indus,
the silk came by water across the Arabian Ocean, up the Red Sea, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</span>
thence over the Isthmus of Suez, or, perhaps, rather by the overland
route, through Persia, to the small but commercial island of Cos (now
Koss), lying off the coast of Asia Minor. Pamphile, daughter of Plates,
is reported to have first woven it (silk) in Cos.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Here, by female hands,
were wrought those light thin gauzes which became so fashionable among
some high dames, but while so often spoken of by the poets of the
Augustan period, were stigmatized by some among them, as well as by
the heathen moralists of after ages, as anything but seemly for women’s
wear. Thus Tibullus says of this sort of clothing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent4">Illa gerat vestes tenues, quas fœmina Coa</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">She may thin garments wear, which female Coan hands</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Have woven, and in stripes disposed the golden bands.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Years afterwards, thus laments Seneca, the philosopher: “Video sericas
vestes, si vestes vocandæ sunt, in quibus nihil est, quo defendi aut corpus
aut denique pudor possit.” I behold silken garments, if garments they
can be called, which are a protection neither for the body nor for shame.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
And later still, and in the Christian era, an echo to the remarks of
Seneca do we hear in the words of Solinus: “Hoc illud est sericum in
quo ostentare potius corpora quàm vestire, primò feminis, nunc etiam
viris persuasit luxuriæ libido.”<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> This is silk, in which at first women but
now even men have been led, by their cravings after luxury, to show
rather than to clothe their bodies.</p>

<p>While looking over some precious early mediæval MS., often do we
yet find that its beautifully limned and richly gilt illuminations, to keep
them from harm, or being hurt through the rubbings of the next leaf,
have fastened beside them a covering of the thinnest gauze, just as we
put in sheets of silver paper for that purpose over engravings. The
likelihood is that some at least of these may be shreds from some of
those thin translucent textiles which found such favour in the fashionable
world for so long a time during the classic period. To some at least of
our readers, the curious example of such gauzy interleafings in the
manuscript of Theodulph, now at Puy en Velay, will occur.</p>

<p>Not only these transparent silken gauzes wrought in Cos, but far more
tasty stuffs, and flowered too, from Chinese looms, found their way to
Asia Minor and Italy. In telling of the barbarous nations then called
the Seres, Dionysius Periegetes writes that they comb the variously
coloured flowers of the desert land to make precious figured garments,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</span>
resembling in colour the flowers of the meadow, and rivalling (in fineness)
the work of spiders.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>As may be easily imagined, silken garments were brought, at an early
period, to imperial Rome. Such, however, were the high prices asked
for them, that few either would or could afford to buy these robes for
their wives and daughters; since, at first, they were looked upon as quite
unbecoming for men’s wear; hence, by a law of the Roman senate under
Tiberius, it was enacted: “Ne vestis serica vicos fœdaret.” While noticing
how womanish Caligula became in his dress, Suetonius remarks his
silken attire: “Aliquando sericatus et cycladatus.”<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> An exception was
made by some emperors for very great occasions, and both Titus and
Vespasian wore dresses of silk when they celebrated at Rome their
triumph over Judæa. Of the emperors who adopted whole silk for
their clothing, Heliogabalus was the first, and so fond was he of the
material, that, in the event of wishing to hang himself, he had got for
the occasion a rope, one strand of which was silk, and the other two
dyed with purple and scarlet: “Paraverat sunes, blatta et serico, et cocco
intortos, quibus si necesse esset, laqueo vitam finiret.”<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>The abnegation of another Roman Emperor, Aurelian, both in respect
of himself and his empress, is, however, very remarkable: “Vestem
holosericam neque ipse in vestiario suo habuit neque alteri utendam dedit.
Et cum ab eo uxor sua peteret, ut unico pallio blatteo serico uteretur, ille
respondit absit, ut auro fila pensentur. Libra enim auri tunc libra serici
suit.”<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Aurelian neither had himself in his wardrobe a garment wholly
silk, nor gave one to be worn by another. When his own wife begged
him to allow her to have a single mantle of purple silk, he replied, “Far
be it from us to allow thread to be reckoned worth its weight in gold.”
For then a pound of gold was the price of a pound of silk.</p>

<p>Here it ought to be mentioned that, for some time before this period
a very broad distinction had been drawn, even in the sumptuary laws of
the empire, between garments made wholly, and partially of silk; in
the former, all the web, both woof and warp, is woven of nothing but
silk; in the latter, the woof is of cotton or of thread, the warp only of
silk. This difference in the texture is thus well set forth by Lampridius,
in his life of Alexander Severus, of whom he says: he had few garments
of silk&mdash;he never wore a tunic woven wholly of silk, and he never gave
away cloth made of silk mixed with less valuable stuff. “Vestes sericas
ipse raras habuit; holosericas nunquam induit subsericam nunquam
donavit.”<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>Clothing made wholly or in part out of silk, became every year
more and more sought for. So remunerative was the trade of weaving
the raw material into its various forms, that, by the Justinian pandects,
the revised code of laws for the Roman Empire, drawn up and published
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 533&mdash;a monopoly in it was given to the court, and looms
worked by women were set up in the imperial palace. Thus Byzantium
became, and long continued famous for the beauty of its silken stuffs.
Still, the raw silk itself had to be brought thither from abroad; but a
remedy was very near at hand. Two Greek monks, while spending
many years among the Chinese, had well learned the whole process of
rearing the worm. They came home, and brought back with them a
goodly number of eggs hidden in their walking-staves, likely made of
that hollow tough sort of reed or tall grass, the Arundo Donax; and,
carrying them to Constantinople, they presented these eggs to the
Emperor, who gladly received them. When hatched, the worms were
distributed all over Greece and Asia Minor, and very soon the western
world reared its own silk. Not long afterwards, Persia and India also
became silk-growing countries. In some places, at least in Greece, the
weaving not only of the finer kinds of cloth, but of silk, got at last into
the hands of the Jews. Writing of his travels, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1161, Benjamin
of Tudela tells us that the great city of Thebes contained about two
thousand Jewish inhabitants. These are the most eminent manufacturers
of silk and purple cloth in all Greece.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Telling us how the fleet of our first Richard coasted the shores of
Spain on its voyage to the Holy Land, Hoveden says of Almeria and its
silk factory: “Deinde per nobilem civitatem quæ dicitur Almaria ubi fit
nobile sericum et delicatum quod dicitur sericum de Almaria.”<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> So prized
were these fine delicate textiles that they were paid as tribute to princes:
“Insula de Maiore reddit ei (regi Arragoniæ) trecentos pannos sericos de
Almaria per annum de tributo,” &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>South Italy wrought rich silken stuffs by the end of the eleventh
century; for we are told by our countryman, Ordericus Vitalis, who
died in the first half of the twelfth century, that Mainerius, the abbot of
his monastery of St. Evroul, at Uzey, in Normandy, on coming home,
brought with him from Apulia several large pieces of silk, and gave to
the Church four of the finest ones, with which four copes were made for
the chanters: “De pallis quas ipse de Apulia detulerat quatuor de preciosioris
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</span>

<p>From a feeling alive in every heart throughout the length and breadth
of Christendom that the best of all things ought to be given for the service
of its religious rites, the garments of its celebrating priesthood, from the
far east to the uttermost west, were, if not always, at least very often
wholly of silk&mdash;holosericus. To this fact we have pointed for the sake of
remembering that were it not so, we had been, at this day, without the
power of being able to see through the few but tattered shreds before us,
what elegantly designed and gorgeous stuffs the foreign mediæval loom
could weave, and what beautiful embroidery our own countrywomen
knew so well how to work. These specimens help us also to rightly
understand the description of those splendid vestments and ritual appliances
enumerated with such exactness in the old inventories of our
venerable cathedrals and parish churches as well as the early wardrobe
accompts of our kings, the wills and bequests of our dignified ecclesiastics
and nobility, to some of which documents we shall have to refer a
little later.</p>

<p>In coming westward among us, all these so much coveted stuffs brought
along with them their own several names by which they were commonly
known throughout the east, whether Greece, Asia Minor, or Persia.
Hence when we read of Samit, ciclatoun, cendal, baudekin, and other
such terms quite unknown to trade now-a-day, we should bear in mind
that notwithstanding the wide variety of spelling, or rather misspelling,
each of these appellations has run through, we reach at last their true
derivations, and so happily get to know in what country and by whose
hands they were wrought.</p>

<p>As trade grew up, she brought these fine silken textiles to our markets,
and articles of dress were made of silk for men’s as well as women’s wear
among the wealthy. At what period the raw material came to be imported
here, not so much for embroidery as to be wrought in the loom,
we do not exactly know; but from several sides we learn that our
countrywomen of all degrees busied themselves in weaving. Among the
home occupations of maidens dedicated to God, St. Aldhelm, at the end
of the seventh century, seems to number: “Cortinarum sive stragularum
textura.”<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> In the council at Cloveshoo, under Archbishop Cuthbert,
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 747, nuns are exhorted to spend their time in reading or singing
psalms rather than weaving and knitting vainglorious garments of many
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</span>
colours: “Magisque legendis libris vel canendis psalmis, quam texendis et
plectendis vario colore inanis gloriæ vestibus studeant operam dare.”<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> By
that curious old English book, the “Ancren Riwle,” written towards the
end of the twelfth century, ankresses are forbidden to make purses to gain
friends therewith, or blodbendes.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Were it not that the weaving especially
of silk, was so generally followed in the cloister by English women,
it had been useless to have so strongly discountenanced the practice.</p>

bleeding, are curiously illustrative of an old national custom for health-sake
kept up in the remembrance of some old folks still living, of periodical
blood-letting. To his practices upon the heads and chins of people the
barber at no remote period, added that of bleeding them; and the old
English barber surgeons held a high position among the gilds of London.
To show where he lived each member of that brotherhood had hanging
out from the walls of his house a long thin pole painted spirally black
and white, the white in token of the blodbende or bandage to be winded
and kept about the patient’s arm.</p>

<p>But on silk weaving by our women in small hand-looms, a very important
witness, especially about several curious specimens in this collection,
is John Garland, born at the beginning of the thirteenth century in
London, where his namesakes and likely of his stock, were and are known.
First, a John Garland, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1170, held a prebend’s stall in St. Paul’s
Cathedral.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Another, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1211, was sheriff, at a later period.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> A
third, a wealthy draper of London, gave freely towards the building of a
church in Somersetshire.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> A fourth, who died <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1461, lies buried in
St. Sythe’s;<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> and, at the present day, no fewer than twenty-two trades-men
of that name, of whom six are merchants of high standing in the
city, are mentioned in the London Post Office Directory for this year
1868. We give these instances as some have tried to rob us of John
Garland by saying he was not an Englishman, though of himself he had
said: “Anglia cui mater fuerat, cui gallia nutrix,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>In a sort of very short dictionary, drawn up by that writer, and printed
at the end of “Paris sous Philippe Le Bel,” edited by M. H. Geraud, our
countryman says: “Textrices quæ texunt serica texta projiciunt fila
aurata officio cavillarum et percuciunt subtemina cum linea (lignea?)
spata: de textis vero fiunt cingula et crinalia divitum mulierum et stole
sacerdotum.”<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Though short, this passage is curious and valuable. From
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</span>
it we learn that, besides the usual homely textiles, those more costly cloth-of-gold
webs were wrought by our women, and very likely, among their
other productions&mdash;cingula&mdash;were those “blodbendes,” the weaving of
which had been forbidden to ankresses and nuns; perhaps, too, of those
narrow gold-wrought ribbons in this collection, pp. 24, 33, 38, 217, 218,
219, 221, &amp;c., some may have been so employed by our high-born dames
on occasion of their being bled, since as late as the sixteenth century some
seasons were deemed fit, others quite unfitting for the operation. Hence,
in his Richard II. act 1, scene i. Shakespeare makes the king to warn
those wrath-kindled gentlemen, Bolingbroke and Norfolk:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Our doctors say this is no month to bleed.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_43" href="#FNanchor_43" class="label">[43]</a> Ib. 607.</p>
</div>

<p>And our most popular books in olden time, one the Shepherd’s Kalendar,
speaking about the signs of the zodiack, tell us which of the twelve
months are either good, evil, or indifferent for blood-letting.</p>

<p>John Garland’s “cingula” may also mean those rich girdles or sashes
worn by our women round the waist, and of which we have one in this
collection, <a href="#h-8571">No. 8571</a>, p. 218. Of this sort, is that border&mdash;amber coloured
silk and diapered&mdash;round a vestment found in a grave at Durham, and
like “a thick lace, one inch and a quarter broad&mdash;evidently owing its
origin, not to the needle, but to the loom,” &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> For the artist wishful
to be correct concerning the head-gear of ladies from Anglo-Saxon times
till the end of the later Plantagenets, this collection can furnish examples
of those bands in those narrow textiles spoken of by our John Garland.
For an after-period those bands are shown on the statuary, and amid the
limning in illuminated MSS. of the thirteenth century; as instances of the
narrow girdle, may be viewed a lady’s effigy, in Romney church, Hants;
and that of Ann of Bohemia, in Westminster Abbey; both to be found in
Hollis’s Monumental Effigies of Great Britain; for the band about the
head, the examples in the wood-cuts in Planchè’s British Costumes,
p. 116.</p>

<p>Of such head-bands we have one at number <a href="#h-8569">8569</a>, p. 217, and other
three mentioned upon <a href="#Page_221">p. 221</a>. They are, no doubt, the old snôd of the
Anglo-Saxon period. For high-born dames they were wrought of silk
and gold; those of lower degree wore them of simpler stuff. The silken
snood, affected to the present hour by young unmarried women in Scotland,
is a truthful witness to the fashion in vogue during Anglo-Saxon
and later times in this country.</p>

<p>From what has been here brought forward, it will be seen that of silk,
whence it came or what was its kind, nothing was truly understood, even
by the learned, for many ages. While, then, we smile at Virgil and the
other ancients for thinking that silk was a sort of herbaceous fleece growing
upon trees, let us not forget that not so many years ago our own Royal
Society printed a paper in which it is set forth that the yet-called Barnacle
Goose comes from a mussel-like bivalve shell, known as the “Anatifa,”
or Barnacle, an origin for the bird still believed in by some of our seafaring
folks, and fostered after a manner by well-read people by the scientific
nomenclature of the shell and the vernacular epithet for the goose. In
the twelfth century, our countryman, Alexander Neckham, foster-brother
to our Richard I., wrote of this marvel thus: “Ex lignis
abiegnis salo diuturno tempore madefactis originem sumit avis quæ vulgo
dicitur bernekke,” &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Such, however, was the Cirencester Augustinian
friar’s knowledge of natural history, that, at least four hundred
years ere the Royal Society had a being amongst us, he thus spurns the
popular belief upon the subject:&mdash;</p>

<p>The breeding of the worm and the manufacture of its silk both spread
themselves with steady though slow steps over most of those countries
which skirt the shores of the Mediterranean; so that, by the tenth century,
those processes had reached from the far east to the uttermost western
limits of that same sea. Even then, and a long time after, the natural
history of the silkworm became known but to a very few. Our aforesaid
countryman, Alexander Neckham, made Abbot of Cirencester, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1213,
was, it is likely, the first who, while he had learned, tried in his popular
work, “De Natura Rerum,” to help others to understand the habits of
the insect: “Materiam vestium sericarum contexit vermis qui bombex
dicitur. Foliis celsi, quæ vulgo morus dicitur, vescitur, et materiam
serici digerit; postquam vero operari cœperit, escam renuit, labori delicioso

<p>Of those several raw materials that have, from the earliest periods,
been employed in weaving, though not in such frequency as silk, one is</p>

<h4 id="gold"><span class="smcap">Gold</span>,</h4>

<p>which, when judiciously brought in, brings with it, not a barbaric, but
artistical richness.</p>

<p>The earliest written notice we have about the employment of this precious
metal in the loom, or of the way in which it was wrought for such
a purpose, we find set forth in the Pentateuch, where Moses tells us that
he (Beseleel) made of violet and purple, scarlet and fine linen, the vestments
for Aaron to wear when he ministered in the holy places. So he
made an ephod of gold, violet, and purple, and scarlet twice dyed, and
fine twisted linen, with embroidered work; and he cut thin plates of gold
and drew them small into strips, that they might be twisted with the
woof of the aforesaid colours.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Instead of “strip,” the authorized version
says, “wire,” another translation reads “thread;” but neither can be
right, for both of these English words mean a something round or twisted
in the shape given to the gold before being wove, whereas the metal
must have been worked in quite flat, as we learn from the text.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_48" href="#FNanchor_48" class="label">[48]</a> Exodus xxxix. 1, 2, 3.</p>

</div>

<p>This brings us to a short notice of</p>

<h4 id="cloth-of-gold"><span class="smcap">Cloth of Gold, or Tissue</span>.</h4>

<p>The use of gold for weaving, both along with linen or quite by itself,
existed, it is likely, among the Egyptians, long before the days of Moses.
In either way of its being employed, the precious metal was at first
wrought in a flattened, never in a round or wire shape. To this hour
the Chinese and the people of India work the gold into their stuffs after
the first and ancient form. In this fashion, to even now, the Italians
love to weave their lama d’oro, or the more glistening toca&mdash;those
cloths of gold which, to all Asiatic and many European eyes, do not
glare with too much garishness, but shine with a glow that befits the
raiment of personages in high station.</p>

<p>Among the nations of ancient Asia, garments made of webs dyed with
the costly purple tint, and interwoven with gold, were on all grand occasions
worn by kings and princes. So celebrated did the Medes and Persians
become in such works of the loom, that cloths of extraordinary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</span>
beauty got their several names from those peoples, and Medean, Lydian,
and Persian textiles came to be everywhere sought for with eagerness.</p>

<p>Writing of the wars carried on in Asia and India by Alexander the
Great, almost four centuries before the birth of Christ, Quintus Curtius
often speaks about the purple and gold garments worn by the Persians
and more eastern Asiatics. Among the many thousands of those who
came forth from Damascus to the Greek general, Parmenio, many were
so clad: “Vestes ... auro et purpura insignes induunt.”<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> All over
India the same fashion was followed in dress. When an Indian king,
with his two grown-up sons, came to Alexander, all three were so
arrayed: “Vestis erat auro purpuraque distincta, &amp;c.”<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Princes and the
high nobility, all over the East, are by Quintus Curtius called, “purpurati.”<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
Not only garments but hangings were made of the same costly
fabric. When Alexander wished to afford some ambassadors a splendid reception,
the golden couches upon which they lay to eat their meat were
screened all about with cloths of gold and purple: “Centum aurei lecti
modicis intervallis positi erant: lectis circumdederat (rex Alexander)
ælæa purpura auroque fulgentia, &amp;c.”<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> But these Indian guests themselves
were not less gorgeously arrayed in their own national costume,
as they came wearing linen (perhaps cotton) garments resplendent with
gold and purple: “Lineæ vestes intexto auro purpuraque distinctæ, &amp;c.”<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>The dress worn by Darius, as he went forth to do battle, is thus described
by the same historian: The waist part of the royal purple tunic
was wove in white, and upon his mantle of cloth of gold were figured
two golden hawks as if pecking at one another with their beaks: “Purpureæ
tunicæ medium album intextum erat: pallam auro distinctam
aurei accipitres, velut rostris inter se concurrerent, adornabant.”<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>From the east this love for cloth of gold reached the southern end of
Italy, called Magna Græcia, and thence soon got to Rome; where, even
under its early kings and much later under its emperors, garments made
of it were worn. Pliny, speaking of this rich textile, says:&mdash;Gold may
be spun or woven like wool, without any wool being mixed with it. We
are informed by Verrius, that Tarquinius Priscus rode in triumph in a
tunic of gold; and we have seen Agrippina, the wife of the Emperor
Claudius, when he exhibited the spectacle of a naval combat, sitting by
him, covered with a robe made entirely of woven gold without any other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxvii">[Pg xxvii]</span>
material.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> In fact, about the year 1840, the Marquis Campagna dug up,
near Rome, two old graves, in one of which had been buried a Roman
lady of high birth, inferred from the circumstance that all about her remains
were found portions of such fine gold flat thread, once forming the
burial garment with which she had been arrayed for her funeral: “Di
due sepolcri Romani, del secolo di Augusto scoverti tra la via Latina e
l’Appia, presso la tomba degli Scipioni.”</p>

<p>Now we get to the Christian epoch. When Pope Paschal, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 821,
sought for the body of St. Cecily, who underwent martyrdom <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 230,
the pontiff found, in the catacombs, the maiden bride whole, and dressed
in a garment wrought all of gold, with some of her raiment drenched in
blood lying at her feet: “Aureis illud (corpus) vestitum indumentis et
linteamina martyris ipsius sanguine plena.”<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> In making the foundations
for the new St. Peter’s at Rome, they came upon and looked into the
marble sarcophagus in which had been buried Probus Anicius, prefect of
the Pretorian, and his wife, Proba Faltonia, each of whose bodies was
wrapped in a winding-sheet woven of pure gold strips.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Maria Stilicho’s
daughter, was wedded to the Emperor Honorius, and died sometime
about <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 400. When her grave was opened, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1544, the golden
tissues in which her body had been shrouded were taken out and melted,
when the yield of precious metal amounted to thirty-six pounds.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> The
late Father Marchi found, among the remains of St. Hyacinthus, martyr,
several fragments of the same kind of golden web, winding sheets of which
were often given by the opulent for wrapping up the dead body of some
poor martyred Christian brother, as is shown by the example specified in
Boldetti’s “Cimiteri de’ santi martiri di Roma.”<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>Childeric, the second and perhaps the most renowned king of the
Merovingean dynasty, died and was buried <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 485, at Tournai. In
the year 1653 his grave was found out, and amid the earth about it so
many remains of pure gold strips were turned up, that there is every
reason for thinking that the Frankish king was wrapped in a mantle of
such golden stuff for his burial.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> That the strips of pure gold out of
which the burial cloak of Childeric was woven were not anywise round,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxviii">[Pg xxviii]</span>
but quite flat, we are warranted in thinking, from the fact that, while
digging in a Merovingean burial ground at Envermeu, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1855, the
distinguished archæologist l’Abbe Cochet came upon the grave once
filled, as it seemed, by a young lady whose head had been wreathed with
a fillet of pure golden web, the tissue of which is thus described: “Ces
fils aussi brillants et aussi frais que s’ils sortaient de la main de l’ouvrier,
n’étaient ni étirés ni cordés. Ils étaient plats et se composaient tout
semplement de petites lanières d’or d’un millimètre de largeur, coupée à
même une feuille d’or épaisse de moins d’un dixième de millimètre. La
longueur totale de quelques-uns atteignait parfois jusqu’à quinze ou dix-huit
centimètres.”<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>Our own country can furnish an example of this kind of golden
textile. At Chessel Down, in the Isle of Wight, when Mr. Hillier was
making some researches in an old Anglo-Saxon place of burial, the diggers
found pieces of golden strips, thin, and quite flat, which are figured in
M. l’Abbé Cochet’s learned book just quoted.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Of such a rich texture
must have been the vestment covered with precious stones, given
to St. Peter’s Church, at Rome, by Charles of France, in the middle of
the ninth century: “Carolus rex sancto Apostolo obtulit ex purissimo
auro, et gemmis constructam vestem, &amp;c.”<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>In the working of such webs and embroidery for use in the Church, a
high-born Anglo-Saxon lady, Ælthelswitha, with her waiting maids,
spent her life near Ely, where, “aurifrixoriæ et texturis secretius cum
puellulis vacabat, quæ de proprio sumptu, albam casulam suis manibus

<p>Such a weaving of pure gold was, here in England, followed certainly
as late as the beginning of the tenth century; very likely much later.
In the chapter library belonging to Durham Cathedral may be seen,
along with several other very precious liturgical appliances, a stole and
maniple, which happily, for more reasons than one, bear these inscriptions:
“Ælfflaed Fieri Precepit. Pio Episcopo Fridestano.” Queen to Alfred’s
son and successor, Edward the elder was our Ælfflaed who got this stole
and maniple made for a gift to Fridestan, consecrated bishop of Winchester
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 905. With these webs under his eye, Mr. Raine, in his
“Saint Cuthbert,”<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> writes thus: In the first, the ground work of
the whole is woven exclusively with thread of gold. I do not mean
by thread of gold, the silver-gilt wire frequently used in such matters,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxix">[Pg xxix]</span>
but real gold thread, if I may so term it, not round, but flat. This
is the character of the whole web, with the exception of the
figures, the undulating cloud-shaped pedestal upon which they stand,
the inscriptions, and the foliage; for all of which, however surprising it
may appear, vacant spaces have been left by the loom, and they themselves
afterwards inserted with the needle. Further on, in his description
of a girdle, the same writer tells us: Its breadth is exactly seven-eighths
of an inch. It has evidently proceeded from the loom; and its
two component parts are a flattish thread of pure gold, and a thread
of scarlet silk, &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Let it be borne in mind that Winchester was
then a royal city, and abounded, as it did afterwards, with able needle-women.</p>

<p>The employment, till a late period, of flattened gold in silk textiles
is well shown by those fraudulent imitations, and substitution in its
stead of gilt parchment, which we have pointed out among the specimens
in this collection, as may be seen at Nos. <a href="#h-7095">7095</a>, p. 140; <a href="#h-8590">8590</a>, p. 224;

<p>That these Durham cloth-of-gold stuffs for vestments were home
made&mdash;we mean wrought in Anglo-Saxondom&mdash;is likely, and by our
women’s hands, after the way we shall have to speak about further on.</p>

<p>This love for such glittering attire, not only for liturgical use but
secular wear, lasted long in England. Such golden webs went here
under different names; at first they were called “ciclatoun,” “siglaton,”
or “siklatoun,” as the writer’s fancy led him to spell the common
Persian word for them at the time throughout the east.</p>

<p>By the old English ritual, plain cloth of gold was allowed, as now,
to be taken for white, and worn in the Church’s ceremonials as such,
when that colour happened to be named for use by the rubric. Thus
in the reign of Richard II., among the vestments at the Chapel of St.
George, Windsor Castle, there was “unum vestimentum album bonum
de panno adaurato pro principalibus festis B. Mariæ,” &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>St. Paul’s, London, had, at the end of the thirteenth century, two
amices; one an old one, embroidered with solid gold wire: “Amictus
breudatus de auro puro; amictus vetus breudatus cum auro puro.”<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>The use of golden stuffs not unlikely woven in England, but assuredly
worn by royalty here, is curiously shown by the contrast between the
living man clothed in woven gold, and the dead body, and its frightful
state at burial, of Henry I., set forth by Roger Hoveden; who thus writes
of that king: “vide ... quomodo regis potentissimi corpus cujus cervix
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxx">[Pg xxx]</span>
diademite, auro et gemmis electissimis quasi divino splendore vernaverat
... cujus reliqua superficies auro textile tota rutilaverat,” &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>Often was this splendid web wrought so thick and strong, that each
string, whether it happened to be of hemp or of silk, in the warp, had
in it six threads, while the weft was of flat gold shreds. Hence such
a texture was called “samit,” a word shortened from its first and old
Byzantine name “exsamit,” as we shall have to notice further on.
Among several other purchases for the wardrobe of Edward I., in the
year 1300, we find this entry: “Pro samitis pannis ad aurum tam in
canabo quam in serico,” &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> And such was the quantity kept there of
this costly cloth, that the nobles of that king were allowed to buy it
out of the royal stores; for instance, four pieces at thirty shillings each
were sold to the Lord Robert de Clifford, and another piece at the same
price to Thomas de Cammill.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Not only Asia Minor, but the Island
of Cyprus, the City of Lucca, and Moorish Spain, sent us these rich
tissues. The cloth of gold from Spain is incidentally spoken of later
in the Sherborn bequest, p. lvi. Along with other things left behind
him at Haverford castle, by Richard II., were twenty-five cloths of gold
of divers suits, of which four came from Cyprus, the others from
Lucca: “xxv. draps d or de diverses suytes dount iiii. de <i>Cipres</i> les autres
de <i>Lukes</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> How Edward IV. liked cloth-of-gold for his personal wear,
may be gathered from his “Wardrobe Accounts,” edited by Nicolas;
and the lavish use of this stuff ordered by Richard III. for his own
coronation, is recorded in the “Antiquarian Repertory.”<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> The robes
to be worn by the unfortunate Edward V. at this same function were
cloth of gold tissue. “Diverse peces of cloth of gold” were bought by
Henry VII., “of Lombardes.”<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>A “gowne of cloth-of-gold, furred with pawmpilyon, ayenst Corpus

Portraits in the year, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1866, in the South Kensington Museum. This
stuff seems to have been costly then, for Princess, afterwards Queen

<p>Cloth of gold called</p>

<h4 id="tissue"><span class="smcap">Tissue</span>.</h4>

<p>As between common silk and satin, there runs a broad difference, at
least in look, one being dull, the other smooth and glossy, so there is
a great distinction to be made among cloths of gold; some are, so to say,
dead; others, brilliant and sparkling. When the gold is twisted into its
silken filament, it takes the deadened look; when the flattened, filmy
strip of metal is rolled about it so evenly as to bring its edges close to
one another, it seems to be one unbroken wire of gold, sparkling and
lustrous, like what is now known as “passing,” and, during the middle
ages, went by the term of Cyprus gold; and rich samits woven with it,
were called damasks of Cyprus.</p>

<p>The very self-same things get for themselves other denominations as
time goes on: such happened to cloths of gold. What the thirteenth
century called, first, “ciclatoun,” then “baudekin,” afterward “nak,”
people, two hundred years later, chose to name “tissue,” or the bright
shimmering golden textile affected so much by our kings and queens in
their dress, for the more solemn occasions of stately grandeur, as was
just now mentioned. Up to this time, the very thin smooth paper made
at first on purpose to be, when this rich stuff lay by, put between its
folds to hinder it from fraying or tarnish, yet goes, though its original use
is forgotten, by the name of tissue-paper.</p>

<p>The gorgeous and entire set of vestments presented to the altar at
St. Alban’s Abbey, by Margaret, Duchess of Clarence, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1429, and
made of the cloth of gold commonly called “tyssewys,” must have
been as remarkable for the abundance and purity of the gold in its
texture, as for the splendour of the precious stones set on it, as well as
the exquisite beauty of its embroideries: “Obtulit etiam unum vestimentum
integrum cum tribus capis choralibus de panno Tyssewys vulgariter
nuncupato in quibus auri pretiosa nobilitas, gemmarum pulchritudo
et curiosa manus artificis stuporem quendam inspectantium oculis repræsentant.”
<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
The large number of vestments made out of gold tissue, and
of crimson, light blue, purple, green, and black, once belonging to York
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxii">[Pg xxxii]</span>
Cathedral, are all duly registered in the valuable “Fabric Rolls” of that
Church lately published by the Surtees Society.

<p>Among those many rich and costly vestments in Lincoln Cathedral,
some were made of this sparkling golden tissue contra-distinguished in its
inventory, from the duller cloth of gold, thus: “Four good copes of blew
tishew with orphreys of red cloth of gold, wrought with branches and
leaves of velvet;”<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> “a chesable with two tunacles of blew tishew
having a precious orphrey of cloth of gold.”
<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
</p>

<p>To this day, in some countries the official robes of certain dignitaries
are wrought of this rich textile. Even now, these Roman princes, and
the senator whose place on great festivals when the Pope is present, is
about the pontifical throne, are all arrayed in state garments made of
cloth of gold.</p>

<p>Silken textures ornamented with designs in copper gilt thread, were
brought into market and honestly sold for what they really were: of such
inferior wares we find mention in the inventory of vestments at Winchester
Cathedral, drawn up by order of Henry VIII. where we read of
“twenty-eight copys of white bawdkyne, woven with copper gold.”<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
The substitution of gilt parchment for metal will be noticed further on,
Section vi.</p>

<p>To imitate cloth of gold, the gilding of silk and fine canvas, like our
gilding of wood and other substances, though not often, was sometimes
resorted to for splendour’s sake on momentary occasions; such, for instance,
as some stately procession, or a solemn burial service. Mr. Raine tells us
he got from a grave at Durham, among other textiles, “a robe of thinnish
silk; the ground colour of the whole is amber; and the ornamental
parts were literally covered with <i>leaf gold</i>, of which there remained
distinct and very numerous portions.”<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> In the churchyard of Cheam,
Surrey, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1865, was found the skeleton of a priest buried there some
time during the fourteenth century; around the waist was a flat girdle
made of brown silk that had been gilt, and a shred of it now lies before
the writer.</p>

<p>In the “Romaunt of the Rose,” translated by Chaucer, Dame Gladnesse
is thus described:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the year 1295, St. Paul’s, London, had: “Casula de panno inaurato

<h4 id="silver"><span class="smcap">Silver</span>,</h4>

<p>was hammered out into very thin sheets, which were cut into narrow
long shreds to be woven, unmixed with anything else, into a web for
garments fitting for the wear of kings. Of this we have a striking illustration
in the “Acts,” where St. Luke, speaking of Herod Agrippa, tells
us that he presented himself arrayed in kingly apparel, to the people, who
to flatter him, shouted that his was the voice, not of a man, but
of a god; and forthwith he was smitten by that loathsome disease&mdash;eaten
up by worms&mdash;which shortly killed him.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> This royal robe,
as Josephus informs us, was a tunic all made of silver and wonderful in
its texture. Appearing in this dress at break of day in the theatre, the
silver, lit up by the rays of the early morning’s sun, gleamed so brightly
as to startle the beholders in such a manner that some among them, by
way of glozing, shouted out that the king before them was a god.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>Intimately connected with the raw materials, and how they were
wrought in the loom, is the question about the time when</p>

<h4 id="wire-drawing"><span class="smcap">Wire-Drawing</span></h4>

<p>was found out. At what period, and among what people the art of
working up pure gold, or gilded silver, into a long, round, hair-like thread&mdash;into
what may be correctly called “wire”&mdash;began, is quite unknown.
That with their mechanical ingenuity the ancient Egyptians bethought
themselves of some method for the purpose, is not unlikely. From Sir
Gardiner Wilkinson, we learn that at Thebes there was found the appearance
of gold wire.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Of those remarkable pieces of Egyptian handicraft
the corslets sent by King Amasis&mdash;one to Lindus, the second to Lacædemon&mdash;of
which we have already spoken (p. xiv.), we may fairly presume
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxiv">[Pg xxxiv]</span>
that the work upon them done by the needle in gold, required by
its minuteness that the precious metal should be not flat, but in the shape
of a real wire. By the delicate management of female fingers, the usual
narrow flat strips might have been pinched or doubled up, so that the two
edges should meet, and then rubbed between men’s harder hands, or
better still, between two pieces of smooth highly-polished granite, would
produce a golden wire of any required fineness. Belonging to the writer is
an Egyptian gold ring, which was taken from off the finger of a mummy
by a friend. The hoop is a plain, somewhat thick wire. On each side of its
small green-dyed ivory scarabee, to keep it in its place, are wound several
rounds of rather fine wire. In Etruscan and Greek jewellery, wire is
often to be found; but in all instances it is so well shaped and so even,
that no hammer could have hardly wrought it, and it must have been
fashioned by some rolling process. All through the mediæval times the
filigree work is often very fine and delicate. Likely is it that the embroidery
which we thus read of in the descriptions of the vestments
belonging whilom to our old churches, for instance: “amictus breudatus
cum auro puro”<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>&mdash;was worked with gold wire. To go back to Anglo-Saxon
times in this country, such gold wire would seem to have been
well known and employed, since in Peterborough minster there were
two golden altar-cloths: “ii. gegylde ƿeofad sceatas;”<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> and at Ely
Cathedral, among its old ritual ornaments, were, in the reign of William
Rufus: “Duo cinguli, unus totus de auri filo, alter de pallio cujus pendentia”
(the tassels) “sunt bene ornata de auri filo.”<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>The first idea of a wire-drawing machine dawned upon a workman’s
mind in the year 1360, at Nuremberg; and yet it was not until two hundred
years after, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1560, that the method was brought to England.
One sample of a stuff with pure wire in it may be seen, p. 220, <a href="#h-8581">No. 8581</a>,
in this collection, as well as at <a href="#h-8228">No. 8228</a>, p. 150.</p>

<p>Equally interesting to our present subject is the process of twining
long narrow strips of gold, or in its stead gilt silver, round a line of silk
or flax, and thus producing</p>

<h4 id="gold-thread"><span class="smcap">Gold Thread</span>.</h4>

<p>Probably its origin, as far as flax and not silk is concerned, as being the
underlying substance, is much earlier than has been supposed; and when
Attalus’s name was bestowed upon a new method of interweaving gold
with wool or linen, it happened so not because that Pargamanean king
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxv">[Pg xxxv]</span>
had been the first to think of twisting gold about a far less costly material,
and thus, in fact, making gold thread such as we now have, but through
his having suggested to the weaver the long-known golden thread as a
woof into the textiles from his loom. From this point of view, we may
easily believe what Pliny says: “Aurum intexere in eadem Asia invenit
Attalus rex; unde nomen Attalicis.”<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> In that same Asia King
Attalus invented the method of using a woof of gold; from this circumstance
the Attalic cloths got their name.</p>

<p>That, at least for working embroidery, ladies at an early Christian
period used to spin their own gold thread, would seem from a passage in
Claudian. Writing on the elevation to the consulate of the two brothers
Probinus and Olybrius, at the end of the fourth century, the poet thus
gracefully compliments their aged mother, Proba, who with her own
hands had worked the purple and gold-embroidered robes, the “togæ
pictæ,” or “trabeæ,” to be worn by her sons in their office:</p>

<p>That, in the thirteenth century our own ladies, like the Roman Proba,
themselves used to make the gold thread needed for their own embroidery
is certain; and the process which they followed is set forth as one of the
items among the other costs for that magnificent frontal wrought <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>
1271, for the high altar at Westminster Abbey. As that bill itself, to be
seen on the Chancellor’s Roll for the year 56 of Henry III., affords so

now is widely different from the pound sterling, so then the mark-weight
of gold cost nine marks of money. The “operacio auri” of the above
document consisted in flattening out, by a broad-faced hammer like one
such as our gold-beaters still use, the precious metal into a sheet thin as
our thinnest paper. The “scissura” was the cutting of it afterwards into
long narrow strips, the winding of which about the filaments of the
yellow silk mentioned, is indicated by the word “filatura,” and thus was
made the gold thread of that costly frontal fraught with seed-pearls and
other some, of a much larger size, and garnets, or rather carbuncles, and
enamels, and which took four women three years and three-quarters to
work. At the back it was lined with green frieze or baize&mdash;“cardo de
viridi.”</p>

<p>Such was the superior quality of some gold thread that it was known
to the mediæval world under the name of the place wherein it had been
made. Thus we find a mention at one time of Cyprus gold thread&mdash;“vestimentum
embrowdatum cum aquilis de auro de Cipre;”<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> later, of
Venice gold thread&mdash;“for frenge of gold of Venys at vj<i>s.</i> the ounce;”<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
“one cope of unwaterd camlet laid with strokes of Venis gold.”<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> What
may have been their difference cannot now be pointed out: perhaps the
Cyprian thread was so much esteemed because its somewhat broad shred
of flat gold was wound about the hempen twist beneath it so nicely as to
have the smooth unbroken look of gold wire; while the article from
Venice showed everywhere the twisting of common thread.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Silks had various names</span></h3>

<p>given them, meaning either their kind of texture and dressing, their
colour and its several tints, the sort of design or pattern woven on them,
the country from which they were brought, or the use for which, on
particular occasions, they happened to be especially set apart.</p>

<p>All of these designations are of foreign growth; some sprang up in the
seventh and following centuries at Byzantium, and, not to be found in
classic writers, remain unknown to modern Greek scholars; some are
half Greek, half Latin, jumbled together; other some, borrowed from
the east, are so shortened, so badly and variously spelt, that their Arabic or
Persian derivation can be hardly recognized at present. Yet, without
some slight knowledge of them, we may not understand a great deal
belonging to trade, and the manners of the times glanced at by our old
writers; much less see the true meaning of many passages in our
mediæval English poetry.</p>

<p>Among the terms significative of the kind of web, or mode of getting
up some sorts of silk, we have</p>

<p><i>Holosericum</i>, the whole texture of which, as its Greek-Latin compound
means to say, is warp and woof wholly pure silk: in a passage from
Lampridius, quoted before, <a href="#Page_xix">p. xix.</a>, we learn that so early as the reign of
Alexander Severus, the difference between “vestes holosericæ,” and
“subsericæ,” was strongly marked, and from which we learn that</p>

<p><i>Subsericum</i> implied that such a texture was not entirely, but in part&mdash;likely
its woof&mdash;of silk.</p>

<p>Although the warp only happened to be of silk, while the woof was
of gold, still the tissue was often called “holosericum;” of the vestments
which Beda says<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> S. Gregory sent over here to S. Austin, one is mentioned
by a mediæval writer as “una casula oloserica purpurei coloris
aurea textura”&mdash;a chasuble all silk, of a purple colour, woven with
gold.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Examples of “holosericum” and “subsericum” abound in this
collection.</p>

<p><i>Examitum</i>, <i>xamitum</i>, or, as it is called in our old English documents
so often, <i>samit</i>, is a word made up of two Greek ones, εξ, “six,” and
μίτοι, “threads,” the number of the strings in the warp of the texture.
That stuffs woven so thick must have been of the best, is evident.
Hence, to say of any silken tissue that it was “examitum,” or “samit,”
meant that it was six-threaded, in consequence costly and splendid. At
the end of the thirteenth and beginning of the fourteenth centuries,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxviii">[Pg xxxviii]</span>
“examitum,” as the writer still names the silk, was much used for
vestments in Evesham abbey, as we gather from the “Chronicon”
of that house, published lately for the Master of the Rolls.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> About
the same period, among the best copes, chasubles, and vestments in St.
Paul’s, London, many were made of “sametum;” so Master Radulph
de Baldock chose to call it in his visitation of that church as its dean,
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1295.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> As we observed just now, these rich silks, which were in
all colours, with a warp so stiff, became richer still from having a woof
of golden thread, or, as we should now say, being shot with gold. But
years before, “examitum” was shortened into “samet;” for among the
nine gorgeous chasubles bequeathed to Durham cathedral by its bishop,
Hugh Pudsey, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1195, there was the “prima de rubea samete nobiliter
braudata cum laminis aureis et bizanciis et multis magnis perlis et lapidibus
pretiosis.”<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> About a hundred years afterwards the employment of
it, after its richest form, in our royal wardrobes, has been pointed out
just now, <a href="#Page_xxviii">p. xxviii.</a>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In that valuable inventory, lately published, of the rich vestments belonging
to Exeter cathedral, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1277, of its numerous chasubles, dalmatics,
tunicles, besides its seventy and more copes, the better part were
made of this costly tissue here called “samitta;” for example: “casula,
tunica, dalmatica de samitta&mdash;par (vestimentorum) de rubea samitta cum avibus
duo capita habentibus;” “una capa samitta cum leonibus deauratis.”<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
In a later document, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1327, this precious silk is termed “samicta.”<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>Many of the beautifully figured damasks in this collection are what
anciently were known as “samits;” and if they really be not “six-thread,”
according to the Greek etymology of their name, it is because,
that at a very early period the stuffs so called ceased to be woven of such
a thickness.</p>

<p>Those strong silks of the present day with the thick thread called
“organzine” for the woof, and a slightly thinner thread known by the
technical name of “tram” for the warp, may be taken to represent the
ancient “examits.”</p>

<p>Just as remarkable for the lightness of its texture, as happened to be
“samit” on account of the thick substance of its web, yet quite as much
sought after, was another kind of thin glossy silken stuff “wrought in the
orient” by Paynim hands, and here called first by its Persian name
which came with it, <i>ciclatoun</i>, that is, bright and shining; but afterwards
<i>sicklatoun</i>, <i>siglaton</i>, <i>cyclas</i>. Often a woof of golden thread lent it more
glitter still; and it was used equally for ecclesiastical vestments as for
secular articles of stately dress. In the “Inventory of St. Paul’s Cathedral,
London,” <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1295, there was a cope made of cloth of gold, called
“ciclatoun:”&mdash;“capa de panno aureo qui vocatur ciclatoun.”<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>When in the field, over their armour, whether of mail or plate,
knights wore a long sleeveless gown slit up almost to the waist on both
sides: sometimes of “samit,” often of “cendal,” oftener still of “ciclatourn,”
because of its flowing showy texture was this garment made, and
from a new and contracted way of calling it, the name of the gown, like
the shortened one for its stuff, became known as “cyclas,” nothing akin
to the κυκλας&mdash;the full round article of dress worn by the women of
Greece and Rome. When, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1306, before setting out to Scotland,
Edward I. girded his son, the prince of Wales, with so much pomp, a
knight, in Westminster Abbey; to the three hundred sons of the nobility
whom the heir to the throne was afterward to dub knights in the same
church, the king made a most splendid gift of attire fitting for the ceremony,
and among other textiles sent them were these “clycases” wove
of gold:&mdash;“Purpura, bissus, syndones, cyclades auro textæ,” &amp;c. as we
learn from Matthew Westminster, “Flores Historiarum,” p. 454. How
very light and thin must have been all such garments, we gather from
the quiet wit of John of Salisbury while jeering the man who affected to
perspire in the depth of winter, though clad in nothing but his fine
“cyclas:”&mdash;“dum omnia gelu constricta rigent, tenui sudat in cylade.”<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

the way of writing the word altered as time went on. When Sir Guy

<p>as their long cyclases which they wore over their armour were of
cendal, so too were of cendal, all blazoned with their armorial bearings,
the housing of the steeds they strode. Of cendal, also, was the lining
of the church’s vestments, and the peaceful citizen’s daily garments.
Of his “Doctour of Phisike,” Chaucer tells us:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sarcenet</i>, during the fifteenth century took by degrees the place of
cendal, at least here in England.</p>

<p>By some improvement in their weaving of cendal, the Saracens, it is
likely in the south of Spain, earned for this light web as they made it, or
sold it, a good name in our markets, and it became much sought for here.
Among other places, York Cathedral had several sets of curtains for its
high altar, “de sarcynet.”<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> At first we distinguished this stuff by calling
it, from its makers, “saracenicum.” But while Anglicising, we shortened
that appellation into the diminutive “sarcenet;” and this word we keep
to the present day, for the thin silk which of old was known among us
as “cendal.”</p>

<p><i>Satin</i>, though far from being so common as other silken textures, was
not unknown to England, in the middle ages; and of it thus speaks
Chaucer, in his “Man of Lawes Tale:”</p>

<p>But as Syria herself never grew the more precious kinds of spices, so
we do not believe that she was the first to hit upon the happy mechanical
expedient of getting up a silken texture so as to take, by the united action
at the same moment of strong heat and heavy pressure upon its face, that
lustrous metallic shine which we have in satin. <a href="#h-702">No. 702</a>, p. 8, is a good
example of late Chinese manufacture, a process which this country is
only now beginning to understand and successfully employ.</p>

<p>When satin first appeared in trade, it was all about the shores of the
Mediterranean called “aceytuni.” This term slipped through early
Italian lips into “zetani;” coming westward this, in its turn, dropped its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xliii">[Pg xliii]</span>
“i,” and smoothed itself into “satin,” a word for this silk among
us English as well as our neighbours in France, while in Italy it now
goes by the name of “raso,” and the Spaniards keep up its first designation
in their dictionary.</p>

<p>In the earlier inventories of church vestments, no mention can be
found of satin; and it is only among the various rich bequests (ed. Oliver)
made to his cathedral at Exeter by Bishop Grandison, between <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>
1327-69 that this fine silk is spoken of; though later, and especially in
the royal wardrobe accompts (ed. Nicolas), it is perpetually specified.
Hence we may fairly assume that till the beginning of the fourteenth century
satin was unknown in England; afterwards it met much favour.
Flags were made of it. On board the stately ship in which Beauchamp,
Earl of Warwick, in the reign of Henry VI., sailed from England to
France, there were flying “three penons of satten,” besides “sixteen
standards of worsted entailed with a bear and a chain,” and a great
streamer of forty yards in length and eight yards in breadth, with a great
bear and griffin holding a ragged staff poudred full of ragged staffs.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
Like other silken textiles, satin seems to have been, in some few instances,
interwoven with flat gold thread, so as to make it a tissue: for
example, Lincoln had of the gift of one of its bishops, eighteen copes of
red tinsel sattin with orphreys of gold.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>Though not often, yet sometimes do we read of a silken stuff called,
<i>cadas</i>, <i>carda</i>, <i>carduus</i>, and used for inferior purposes. The outside silk
on the cocoon is of a poor quality compared with the inner filaments,
from which it is kept quite apart in reeling, and set aside for other uses;
this is <i>cadas</i> which the Promptorium Parvulorum defines, however, as
“Bombicinium,” or silk. St. Paul’s, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1295, had “pannus rubeus
diasperatus de Laret lineatus de carda Inda;”<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> and Exeter possessed
another cloth for the purpose: “Cum carduis viridibus.”<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> More
frequently, instead of being spun it served as wadding in dress; on
the barons at the siege of Caerlaverock, might be seen many a rich
gambeson garnished with silk, cadas, and cotton:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Camoca</i>, <i>camoka</i>, <i>camak</i>, <i>camora</i> (a misspelling), as the name is differently
written, was a textile of which in England we hear nothing before the
latter end of the fourteenth century. No sooner did it make its appearance
than this camoca rose into great repute; the Church used it for her
liturgical vestments, and royalty employed it for dress on grand occasions
as well as in adorning palaces, especially in draping beds of state. In
the year 1385, besides some smaller articles, the royal chapel in Windsor
Castle had a whole set of vestments and other ornaments for the altar, of
white camoca: “Unum vestimentum album de camoca,” &amp;c....
“Album de camoca, cum casula.”<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>... “Duo quissini rubei de
camoca.”<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> To his cathedral of Durham, the learned Richard Bury left
a beautifully embroidered whole set of vestments, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1345: “Unum
vestimentum de alma camica (<i>sic</i>) subtiliter brudata,” &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>Our princes must have arrayed themselves, on grand occasions, in
camoca; for thus Herod, in one of the Coventry Misteries&mdash;the Adoration
of the Magi&mdash;is made to boast of himself: “In kyrtyl of cammaka
kynge am I cladde.”<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> But it was in draping its state-beds that our ancient
royalty showed its affection for camoca. To his confessor, Edward the
Black Prince bequeaths “a large bed of red camora (<i>sic</i>) with our arms
embroidered at each corner,”<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> and the prince’s mother leaves to another
son of hers, John Holland, “a bed of red camak.”<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> Our nobles, too, had
the same likings, for Edward Lord Despencer, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1375, wills to his wife,
“my great bed of blue camaka, with griffins, also another bed of camaka,
striped with white and black.”<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> What may have been the real texture
of this stuff, thought so magnificent, we do not positively know, but
hazarding a guess, we think it to have been woven of fine camel’s hair
and silk, and of Asiatic workmanship.</p>

<p>From this mixed web pass we now to another, one even more precious,
that is the <i>Cloth of Tars</i>, which we presume to have, in a manner, been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xlv">[Pg xlv]</span>
the forerunner of the now so celebrated cashmere, and along with silk
made of the downy wool of a family of goats reared in several parts of
Asia, but especially in Tibet, as we shall try to show a little further on.</p>

<p><i>Velvet</i> is a silken textile, the history of which has still to be written. Of
the country whence it first came, or the people who were the earliest to hit
upon the happy way of weaving it, we know nothing. The oldest piece
we remember to have ever seen was in the beautiful crimson cope embroidered
by English hands in the fourteenth century, now kept at the
college of Mount St. Mary, Chesterfield, and exhibited here in the ever
memorable year ’62.</p>

<p>Our belief is, that to central Asia&mdash;perhaps China,&mdash;we are indebted
for velvet as well as satin, and we think the earliest places in Europe
to weave it was, first the south of Spain, and then Lucca.</p>

<p>In the earlier of those oldest inventories we have of church vestments,
that of Exeter Cathedral, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1277, velvet is not spoken of; but in
St. Paul’s, London, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1295, there is some notice of velvet,<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> along
with its kindred web, “fustian,” for chasubles.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> At Exeter, in the year
1327, velvet&mdash;and it was crimson&mdash;is for the first time there mentioned,
but as in two pieces not made up, of which some yards had been then
sold for vestment-making.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> From the middle of the fourteenth century,
velvet&mdash;mostly crimson&mdash;is of common occurrence.</p>

<p>The name itself of velvet, “velluto,” seems to point out Italy as the
market through which we got it from the East, for the word in Italian
indicates something which is hairy or shaggy, like an animal’s skin.</p>

<p>Fustian was known at the end of the thirteenth century. St. Paul’s
Cathedral had: “Una casula alba de fustian.”<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> But in an English sermon
preached at the beginning of this thirteenth century, great blame is
found with the priest who had his chasuble made of middling fustian:
“þe meshakele of medeme fustian.”<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> As then wove, fustian, about
which we have to say more, had a short nap on it, and one of the
domestic uses to which, during the middle ages, it had been put, was for
bed clothes, as thick undersheets. Lady Bergavenny bequeaths <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>
1434, “A bed of gold of swans, two pair sheets of Raynes (fine linen,
made at Rheims), a pair of fustians, six pair of other sheets, &amp;c.”<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> That
this stuff may have hinted to the Italians the way of weaving silk in the
same manner, and so of producing velvet, is not unlikely. Had the
Egyptian Arabs been the first to push forward their own discovery of
working cotton into fustian, and changing cotton for silk, and so brought
forth velvet, it is probable some one would have told us; as it is, we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xlvi">[Pg xlvi]</span>
yield the merit to Asia&mdash;may be China. Other nations took up this manufacture,
and the weaving of velvet was wonderfully improved. It became
diapered, and upon a ground of silk or of gold, the pattern came out in a
bold manner, with a raised pile; and, at last, that difficult and most beautiful
of all manners of diapering, or making the pattern to show itself in a
double pile, one pile higher than the other and of the same tint, now, as
formerly, known as velvet upon velvet, was brought to its highest perfection:
and velvets in this fine style were wrought in greatest excellence
all over Italy and in Spain and Flanders. Our old inventories often
specify these differences in the making of the web. York cathedral had
“four copes of crimson velvet plaine, with orphreys of clothe of goulde,
for standers;”<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> and besides, “a greene cushion of raised velvet,”<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> possessed
“a cope of purshed velvet (redd)”<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> “purshed” meaning the velvet
raised in a net-work pattern.</p>

<p><i>Diaper</i> was a silken fabric, held everywhere in high estimation during
many hundred years, both abroad and here in England. This we know
from documents beginning with the eleventh century. What was its
distinctive characteristic, and whence it drew its name, we have not
been hitherto told, with anything like certainty. Several eminent men
have discussed these points, but while hazarding his own conjecture, each
of these writers has differed from the others. Till a better may be
found, we submit our own solution.</p>

<p>The silk weavers of Asia had, of old, found out the way so to gear
their looms, and dress their silk, or their threads of gold, that with a
warp and woof, both precisely of the same tone of colour they could
give to the web an elegant design, each part of which being managed
in the weaving, as either to hide or to catch the light and shine, looked
to be separated from or stand well up above the seeming dusky ground
below it: at times the design was dulled, and the ground made glossy.
To indicate such a one-coloured, yet patterned silk, the Byzantine
Greeks of the early middle ages bethought themselves of the term διασπρον,
diaspron, a word of their own coinage, and drawn from the old Greek
verb, διασπαω, I separate, but meant by them to signify “what distinguishes
or separates itself from things about it,” as every pattern must
do on a one-coloured silk. Along with this textile, the Latins took the
name for it from the Greeks, and called it “diasper,” which we English
have moulded into “diaper.” In the year 1066, the Empress Agnes
gave to Monte Cassino a diaper-chasuble of cloth of gold, “optulit
planetam diasperam totam undique auro contextam.”<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xlvii">[Pg xlvii]</span></p>

<p>How a golden web may be so wrought is exemplified, amid several
other specimens in this collection, by the one under <a href="#h-1270">No. 1270</a>, p. 38,
done most likely by an English hand. At York Minster, in the year
1862, was opened a tomb, very likely that of some archbishop; and
there was found, along with other textiles in silk, a few shreds of what
had been a chasuble made of cloth of gold diapered all over with little
crosses, as we ourselves beheld. It would seem, indeed, that cloth of
gold was at most times diapered with a pattern, at least in Chaucer’s days,
since he thus points to it on the housing of his king’s horse:&mdash;</p>

<p>Our oldest Church inventories make frequent mention of such diapered
silks for vestments. In 1277, Exeter Cathedral had: “una (capa) de
alba diapra cum noviluniis,”<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>&mdash;a cope of white diaper with half
moons. It was the gift of Bishop Bartholomew, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1161. Bishop
Brewer, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1224, bestowed upon the Church a small pall of red
diaper: “parva palla de rubea diapra;” along with a chasuble, dalmatic
and tunicle of white diaper: “casula, &amp;c. de alba diapra.”<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> Among
its vast collection of liturgical garments, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1295, old St. Paul’s had
a large number made of diaper, which was almost always white. Sometimes
the pattern of the diapering is noticed; for instance, a chasuble of
white diaper, with coupled parrots in places, among branches: “casula
de albo diaspro cum citaciis combinatis per loca in ramusculis.”<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> Again:
“tunica et dalmatica de albo diaspro cum citacis viridibus in ramunculis,”<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
where we see the white diaper having the parrots done in green. Probably
the most remarkable and elaborate specimen of diaper-weaving on
record, is the one that Edmund, Earl of Cornwall gave, made up in “a
cope of a certain diaper of Antioch colour, covered with trees and
diapered birds, of which the heads, breasts, and feet, as well as the
flowers on the trees, are woven in gold thread: “Capa Domini Edmundi

<p>By degrees the word “diaper” became widened in its meaning.
Not only all sorts of textile, whether of silk, of linen, or of worsted,
but the walls of a room were said to be diapered when the self-same
ornament was repeated and sprinkled well over it. Thus, to soothe his
daughter’s sorrows, the King of Hungary promises her a chair or carriage,

<p>Even now, our fine table linen we call “diaper,” because it is figured

<p>In their etymology of diaper, modern writers try to draw the word
from Yprès, or d’Ypriès, because that town in Belgium was once celebrated,
not for silken stuffs, but for linen. Between the city and the name
of “diaper” a kinship even of the very furthest sort cannot be fairly set up.
From the citations out of the Chronicle of Monte Cassino we learn,
that at the beginning of the eleventh century, the term in use there for
a certain silken textile, brought thither from the east, was “diasperon.”
We find, too, how that great monastery was in continual communication
with Constantinople, whither she was in the habit of sending her
monks to buy art-works of price, and bring back with them workmen,
for the purpose of embellishing her Church and its altars. Getting from
South Italy to England, and our own records, we discover this same
Greece-born phrase, diaspron, diasper, given to precious silks used as
vestments during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, in London and
Exeter. By the latter end of the fourteenth century&mdash;Chaucer’s time&mdash;the
terms “diasper,” and “diasperatus,” among us, had slidden into
“diaper,” “diaperatus,” Englished, “diapered.” Now, in this same
fourteenth century, do we, for the first time, meet a mention of Yprès;
and not alone, but along with Ghent, as famous for linen, if by that
word we understand cloth; and even then our own Bath seems to have
stood above those Belgian cities in their textiles. Among Chaucer’s
pilgrims&mdash;</p>

<p>Neither in this, nor any other subsequent notice of Yprès weaving, is
there anything which can be twisted into a warrant for thinking the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xlix">[Pg xlix]</span>
distinctive mark to have been the first employment of pattern on its
webs, or even its peculiar superiority in such a style of work. The important
fact which we have just now verified that several ages had gone
by between the period when, in Greece, in South Italy, and England,
the common name for a certain kind of precious silk was “diaspron,”
“diasper,” “diaper,” and the day when, for the first time, Yprès, not
alone, but in company with other neighbouring cities, started up into
notice for its linens, quite overthrows the etymology thought of now-a-days
for the word “diaper,” and hastens us to the conclusion that this
almost ante-mediæval term came to us from Greece, and not from
Flanders.</p>

<p>Of the several oldest pieces in this collection, there are not a few
which those good men who wrote out the valuable inventories of Exeter
and St. Paul’s, London, would have jotted down as “diasper,” or
“diaper.” The shreds of creamy, white silk, number <a href="#h-1239">1239</a>, p. 26,
fully illustrate the meaning of this term, and will repay minute inspection.</p>

<p>More ancient still are other terms which we are about to notice, such
as “chrysoclavus,” “stauracin,” “polystaurium,” “gammadion,” or
“gammadiæ,” “de quadruplo,” “de octoplo,” and “de fundato.” First,
textiles of silk and gold are, over and over again, enumerated as then
commonly known under such names, in the so-called Anastasius Bibliothecarius,
Liber Pontificalis seu de Gestis Romanorum Pontificum, the
good edition of which, in three volumes, edited by Vignolius, ought to
be in the hands of every student of early Christian art-work, and in
particular of textiles and embroidery.</p>

<p>The <i>Chrysoclavus</i> or golden nail-head, was a remnant, which lingered
a long time among the ornaments embroidered on ecclesiastical vestments,
and robes for royal wear, of that once so coveted “latus clavus,”
or broad nail-head-like purple round patch worn upon the outward garment
of the old Roman dignitaries, as we learn from Horace, while
laughing at the silly official whom he saw at Fondi&mdash;</p>

<p>In the Court of Byzantium this device of dignity was elevated, from
being purple on white, into gold upon purple. Hence came it that all
rich purple silks, woven or embroidered, with the “clavus” done in
gold, became known from their pattern as gold nail-headed, or chrysoclavus,
a half Greek half Latin word, employed as often as an adjective
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_l">[Pg l]</span>
as a substantive; and silken textiles of Tyrian dye, sprinkled all over with
large round spots, were once in great demand. Shortly after, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 795,
Pope Leo, among his several other gifts to the churches at Rome, bestowed
a great number of altar frontals made of this purple and gold
fabric, as we are told by Anastasius. To the altar of St. Paul’s the
pontiff sent “vestem super altare albam chrysoclavam;”<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> but to another
“vestem chrysoclavam ex blattin Byzanteo.”<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> Sometimes these
“clavi” were made so large that upon their golden ground an event in
the life of a saint, or the saint’s head, was embroidered, and then the
whole piece was called “sigillata,” or <i>sealed</i>.</p>

<p><i>Stauracin</i>, or “stauracinus,” taking its name from σταυρος, the Greek
for “cross,” was a silken stuff figured with small plain crosses, and therefore
from their number sometimes further distinguished by the word
signifying that meaning in Greek,</p>

<p><i>Polystauron.</i> Of such a textile St. Leo gave presents to churches, as
we learn from Anastasius, lib. Pont. ii. 265.</p>

<p>How much silken textiles figured with the cross were in request for
church adornment we learn from Fortunatus, who, about the year 565,
thus describes the hangings of an oratory in a church at Tours&mdash;</p>

<p>Very often the crosses woven on these fabrics were of the simplest
shape; oftener were they designed after an elaborate type with a symbolic
meaning about it that afforded an especial name to the stuffs upon which
they were figured, the first of which that claims our notice is denominated</p>

<p><i>Gammadion</i>, or <i>Gammadiæ</i>, a word applied as often to the pattern upon
silks as the figures wrought upon gold and silver for use in churches, we
so repeatedly come upon in the “Liber Pontificalis.”</p>

<p>In the Greek alphabet the capital letter of gamma takes the shape of
an exact right angle thus, <span class="sans-serif">Γ</span>. Being so, many writers have beheld in it
an emblem of our Lord as our corner-stone. Following this idea artists
at a very early period struck out a way of forming the cross after several
shapes by various combinations with it of this letter <span class="sans-serif">Γ</span>. Four of these
gammas put so</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>┘└<br />
┐┌</p>
</div>

<p>fall into the shape of the so-called Greek cross; and
in this form it was woven upon the textiles denominated “stauracinæ;”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_li">[Pg li]</span>
or patterned with a cross. Being one of the four same-shaped elements
of the cross’s figure, the part was significant of the whole. Being, too,
the emblem of our corner-stone&mdash;our Lord, the gamma, or <span class="sans-serif">Γ</span>, was shown
at one edge of the tunic on most of the apostles in ancient mosaics;
wherein sometimes we find, in place of the gamma, our present capital
<span class="sans-serif">Η</span> for the aspirate, with which for their symbolic purpose the early
Christians chose to utter, if not, write the sacred name. This <span class="sans-serif">Η</span> is,
however, only another combination of the four gammas in the cross.
Whatsoever, therefore, whether of silver or of silk, was found to be
marked in these or other ways of putting the gammas together, or with
only a single one, such articles were called “gammadion,” or “gammadiæ;”
but as often the so-formed cross was designated as “gammaed,”
or “gammadia.” St. Leo gave to the Church of S. Susanna, at Rome,
an altar-frontal, upon which there were four of such crosses made of
purple silk speckled with gold spots; “vestem de blatthin habentem ...
tabulas chrysoclavas iiii cum gemmis ornatas, atque gammadias in ipsa
veste chrysoclavas iiii.”<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>Ancient ingenuity for throwing its favourite gamma into other combinations,
and thus bringing forth other pretty but graceful patterns to
be wrought on all sorts of ecclesiastical appliances, did not stop here.
In the “Liber Pontificalis” of Anastasius, we meet not unfrequently
with such passages as these: “Cortinas miræ magnitudinis de palliis
stauracin seu quadrapolis;”<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> “vela ... ex palliis quadrapolis seu
stauracin;”<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> “vela de octapolo.”<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> The explanation of these two
terms, “de quadrapolo,” “de octapolo,” has hitherto baffled all commentators
of the text through their forgetfulness of comparing together
the things themselves and the written description of them. In
these texts there is evidently meant a strong contrast between a something
amounting to four, and to eight, in or upon these textiles. It cannot
be to say that one fabric was woven with four, the other with eight
threads: had that been so meant, then the fact would have been announced
by words constructed like “examitus,” p. xxxvii. As the contrast
is not in the texture, it must then be searched for in the pattern of
these two stuffs. Sure enough, there we find it, as “de quadrapolis”
and “stauracin” were, as we see above, interchangeable terms; the
first, like the second sort of textile, was figured with crosses.</p>

<p>Given at the end of Du Cange’s “Glossary” is an engraving of a
work of Greek art, plate IX. Here St. John Chrysostom stands between
St. Nicholas and St. Basil. All three are arrayed in their liturgical
garments, which being figured with crosses, are of the textile called
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lii">[Pg lii]</span>
of old “stauracin;” but a marked difference in the way in which the
crosses are put is discernible. As a metropolitan St. John wears the
saccos upon which the crosses are arranged thus</p>

<div class="figcenter illowe6" id="i-p-liia-top" style="max-width: 6em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i-p-liia-top.png" alt="" />
</div>

<p>St. Nicholas, and St. Basil have chasubles which, though worked all over
with crosses, made, as on St. John’s saccos, with gammas, are surrounded
with other gammas joined so as to edge in the crosses, thus</p>

<div class="figcenter illowe6" id="i-p-liia-bot" style="max-width: 6em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i-p-liia-bot.png" alt="" />
</div>

<p>As four gammas only are necessary to form all the crosses upon St.
John’s vestment, therein we behold the textile called by Anastasius,
“Stauracin de quadruplo,” or the stuff figured with a cross of four
(gammas); while as eight of these Greek letters are required for the
pattern on the chasubles, we have in them an example of the other
“stauracin de octaplo,” or “octapulo,” a fabric with a pattern composed
of eight gammas. But of all the shapes fashioned out of the repetition
of the one same element, the Greek letter <span class="sans-serif">Γ</span>, by far the most ancient, universal,
and mystic, is that curious one particularized by many as the</p>

<p><i>Gammadion</i>, or <i>Filfot</i>, a name by which, at one time in England, it
was generally known. Several pieces in this collection exhibit on them
some modification of it, as Nos. <a href="#h-1261">1261</a>, p. 34; <a href="#h-1325">1325</a>, p. 60; <a href="#h-7052">7052</a>, p. 127;

is made out of the usual four gammas, so that they should fall together
thus <big>卍</big>: of its high antiquity and symbolism, we speak further on,
section VII.</p>

<p>Silks figured with a cross, some made with four, some with eight
Greek gammas, remained in Eastern Church use all through the middle
ages, as we may gather from several monuments of that period. Besides
a good many other books, Gori’s fine one, “Thesaurus Veterum Diptychorum”
affords us several instances.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> The name also remained to
such textiles as we know from the Greek canonist Balsamon, who,
writing about the end of the twelfth century on episcopal garments, calls
the tunic, στιχάριον διὰ γαμμάτων or (with a pattern) of gammas&mdash;gammadion.
How to this day the cross made by four gammas is woven on
Greek vestments, may be observed in the plates we have given in
“Hierurgia.”<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> Two late specimens of “stauracin” are in this collection

<p>Of silks patterned with the Greek cross or “stauracin,” there are
several examples in this collection; and though not of the remotest period,
are interesting; the one <a href="#h-8234">No. 8234</a>, p. 154, wrought in Sicily as it is probable
by the Greeks brought as prisoners from the Morea, in the twelfth
century, is not without some value. In the Chapter Library at Durham
may be seen a valuable sample of Byzantine stauracin “colours purple
and crimson; the only prominent ornament a cross&mdash;often repeated, even
upon the small portion which remains.”<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> Those who have seen in St.
Peter’s sacristy at Rome, that beautiful light-blue dalmatic said to have
been worn by Charlemagne when he sang the Gospel at high mass, at the
altar, vested as a deacon, the day he was crowned emperor in that church
by Pope Leo III. will remember how plentifully it is sprinkled with
crosses between its exquisite embroideries, so as to make the vestment a
real “stauracin.” It has been well given by Sulpiz Boisserée in his
“Kaiser Dalmatika in der St. Peterskirche;” but far better by Dr. Bock
in his splendid work on the Coronation Robes of the German emperors.</p>

<p>Silks, from the pattern woven on them called <i>de fundato</i>, are frequently
spoken of by Anastasius. From the texts themselves of that writer, and
passages in other authors of his time, it would seem that the silks themselves
were dyed of the richest purple, and figured with gold in the pattern
of netting. As one of the meanings for the substantive “funda” is a
fisherman’s net, rich textiles so figured in gold, were denominated from
such a pattern “de fundato” or netted. To St. Peter’s Church at
Rome the pontiff, Leo III. gave “cortinam majorem Alexandrinam
holosericam habentem in medio adjunctum fundatum, et in circuitu ornatum
de fundato;”<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> and for the Church of St. Paul’s, Leo provided
“vela holoserica majora sigillata habentia periclysin et crucem tam de
blattin seu de fundato.”<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> From Fortunatus we gather that those costly
purple-dyed silks called “blatta,” were always interwoven with gold:&mdash;</p>

<p>This net-pattern lingered long, and, no doubt, we find it, under a new

<p>The Latin term “de fundato,” for this net-pattern, so unusual, has for
many been quite a puzzle. Here, too, art-works are our best help
to properly understand the meaning of the word. The person of Constantine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_liv">[Pg liv]</span>
the Great, given by Gori,<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> as well as that of a much later
personage, shown us by Du Cange, at the end of his “Glossarium,”<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>
shows the front of the imperial tunic, which was purple, to have been
figured in gold with a netting-pattern, marked with pearls. Gori, moreover,
presents us with a bishop whose chasuble is of the same design.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>
Further still, Paciaudi, in his “De Cultu S. Johannis Baptistæ,”<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> furnishes
a better illustration, if possible, by an engraving of a diptych first published
by him. Here St. Jacobus, or James, is arrayed in chasuble and pall of
netting-patterned silk; and of the same-figured stuff is much of the trimming
or ornamentation on the robes of the B. V. Mary, but on those
more especially worn by the archangels, St. Michael and Gabriel. In
the diapered pattern on some of the cloth of gold found lately in the grave
of some archbishop of York, buried there about the end of the thirteenth
century, is the same netting discernible.</p>

<p><i>Striped</i> or <i>barred</i> silks&mdash;stragulatæ&mdash;got their especial name for such a
simple pattern, and at one time were in much request. Frequent mention
is made of them in the Exeter Inventories, of which the one taken,
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1277, specifies, “Due palle de baudekyno&mdash;una stragulata;”<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> and
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1327, the same cathedral had, “Unum filatorium de serico bonum
stragulatum cum serico diversi coloris,”<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> a veil or scarf for the sub-deacon,
made of silk striped in different colours. The illuminations on the MS.
among the Harley collection at the British Museum, of the deposition of
Richard II. published by the Society of Antiquaries, afford us instances
of this textile. The young nobleman to the right sitting on the ground
at the archbishop’s sermon, is entirely, hood and all, arrayed in this striped
silk,<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> and at the altar, where Northumberland is swearing on the Eucharist,
the priest who is saying mass, wears a chasuble of the same stuff.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>
Old St. Paul’s had copes like it: “Capæ factæ de uno panno serico
veteri pro parte albi coloris, pro parte viridi;”<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> besides which, it had
offertory-veils of the same pattern, one of them with its stripes paly red
and green:&mdash;“Unum offertorium stragulatum, de rubeo et viridi;” and
two others with their stripes bendy-wise: “Duo offertoria bendata de
opere Saraceno.”<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> York Cathedral also had two red palls paled with
green and light blue: “Duæ pallæ rubiæ palyd cum viridi et blodio,”<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>
so admirably edited for the Surtees Society, by Rev. Jas. Raine, jun.
Under this kind of patterned silks must be put one the name for which
has hitherto not been explained by our English antiquaries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_lv">[Pg lv]</span></p>

<p>At the end of the twelfth century there was brought to England, from
Greece, a sort of precious silk named there <i>Imperial</i>.</p>

<p>Ralph, dean of St. Paul’s cathedral, London, tells us, that William de
Magna Villa, on coming home from his pilgrimage to the Holy Land,
made presents to several churches, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1178, of cloths which at Constantinople
were called imperial: “Pannos quos Constantinopolis civitas
vocat Imperiales, &amp;c.”<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> Relating the story of John’s apparition, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>
1226, Roger Wendover, and after him Matt. Paris, tells us that the King
stood forth dressed in royal robes made of the stuff they call Imperial:
“Astitit rex in vestibus regalibus de panno scilicet quem imperialem
appellant.”<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> In the Inventory of St. Paul’s, London, drawn up <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>
1295, four tunicles, vestments for subdeacons and lower ministers about
the altar, are mentioned as made of this imperial. No colour is specified,
except in the one instance of the silk being marbled; and the patterns
are noticed as of red and green, with lions wove in gold.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> It seems
not to have been thought good enough for the more important vestments,
such as chasubles and copes. Were it not spoken of thus by Wendover
and Paris, as well as by a dean of St. Paul’s, and mentioned once as used
in a few liturgical garments for that cathedral, we had never heard a word
about such a textile anywhere in England. Our belief is that it got its
name neither from its colour&mdash;supposed royal purple&mdash;nor its costliness,
but through quite another reason: woven at a workshop kept up by the
Byzantine emperors, just like the Gobelins is to-day in Paris by the
French, and bearing about it some small, though noticeable mark, it took
the designation of “Imperial.” That it was partly wrought with gold,
we know; but that its tint was always some shade of the imperial purple&mdash;hence
its appellation&mdash;is a purely gratuitous assumption. Moreover, as
Saracenic princes in general had wrought in their own palaces, at the
tiraz there, those silks wanted by themselves, their friends, and officers,
and caused them to be marked with some adopted word or sentence; so,
too, the rulers of Byzantium followed, it is likely the same usage, and put
some royal device or word, or name in Greek upon theirs, and hence such
textiles took the name of Imperial. In France, this textile was in use as
late as the second half of the fifteenth century, but looked upon as old.
Here, at York, as late as the early part of the sixteenth, one of its
deans bestowed on that cathedral “two (blue) copes of clothe imperialle.”

<h4><span class="smcap">Baudekin</span></h4>

<p>Was a costly stuff much employed and often spoken of in our literature
during many years of the mediæval period.</p>

<p>Ciclatoun, as we have elsewhere remarked, was the usual term during
centuries throughout Western Europe, by which those showy golden
textiles were called. When, however, Bagdad, or Baldak, standing
where once stood the Babylon of old, took and held for no short length
of time the lead all over Asia in weaving, every kind of fine silks and in
especial golden stuffs shot, as now, in different colours, cloths of gold so
tinted became every where known more particularly among us English
as “baldakin,” “baudekin,” or “baudkyn,” or silks from Baldak. At
last the earlier term “ciclatoun” dropped quite out of use. With this
before him the reader will hereafter more readily understand several
otherwise puzzling passages in many of our old writers in poetry and
prose, as well as in the inventories of royal furniture and church
vestments.</p>

<p>Our kings and our nobility affected much this rich stuff for the garments
worn by them on high occasions. When, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1247, girding in Westminster
Abbey William de Valence his uterine brother, a knight, our
Henry III. had on a robe of baudekin, or cloth-of-gold, likely shot with
crimson silk: “Dominus Rex veste deaurata facta de preciosissimo
Baldekino et coronula aurea, quæ vulgariter garlanda dicitur redimitus,
sedens gloriose in solio regio, fratrem suum uterinum, baltheo militari
gaudenter insignivit.”<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> In the year 1259 the master of Sherborn Hospital
in the north, bequeathed to that house a cope made of cloth-of-gold, or
“baudekin:”&mdash;“Capam de panno ad aurum scilicet Baudekin cum
vestimento plenario de panno Yspaniæ ad aurum.”<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p>But these Bagdad or Baldak silks, with a weft of gold known among
us as “baudekins” were often wove very large in size, and applied here
in England to especial ritual purposes. As a thanks-offering after a safe
return home from a journey, they were brought and given to the altar;
at all the solemn burials of our kings and queens, and other great ones,
each of the many mourners, when offertory time came, went to the
illuminated hearse,&mdash;one is figured in the “Church of Our Fathers,”<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>&mdash;and
strewed a baudekin of costly texture over the coffin. Artists or
others who wish to know the ceremonial for that occasion, will find it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lvii">[Pg lvii]</span>
set forth in the descriptions of many of our mediæval funerals. At the
obsequies of Henry VII. in Westminster Abbey:&mdash;“Twoe herauds came
to the Duke of Buck. and to the Earles and conveyed them into the
Revestrie where they did receive certen Palles which everie of them did
bringe solemply betwene theire hands and comminge in order one before
another as they were in degree unto the said herse, thay kissed theire said
palles and delivered them unto the said heraudes which laide them uppon
the kyngs corps, in this manner: the palle which was first offered by the
Duke of Buck. was laid on length on the said corps, and the residewe
were laid acrosse, as thick as they might lie.”<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> In the same church at
the burial of Anne of Cleves, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1557, a like ceremonial of carrying
cloth-of-gold palls to the hearse was followed.<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<p>Among the many rich textiles belonging to St. Paul’s, London, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>
1295, are mentioned: “Baudekynus purpureus cum columpnis et
arcubus et hominibus equitantibus infra, de funere comitissæ Britanniæ.
Item baudekynus purpureus cum columpnis et arcubus et Sampson fortis
infra arcus, de dono Domini Henrici Regis. Duo baudekyni rubei cum
sagittarijs infra rotas, de dono E. regis et reginæ venientium de Wallia,
Unus Baudekynus rubei campi cum griffonibus, pro anima Alianoræ reginæ
junioris,”<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> &amp;c. At times these rich stuffs were cut up into chasubles:
“Casula de baudekyno de opere Saracenico,”<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> as was the cloth-of-gold
dress worn by one of our princesses at her betrothal: “Unam vestimentum
rubeum de panno adaurato diversis avibus poudratum, in quo domina
principessa fuit desponsata.”<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> The word “baudekin” itself became at last
narrowed in its meaning. So warm, so mellow, so fast were all the tones
of crimson which the dyers of Bagdad knew how to give their silks, that
without a thread of gold in them, the mere glowing tints of those plain
crimson silken webs from Bagdad won for themselves the name of baudekins.
Furthermore, when they quite ceased to be partly woven in gold, and
from their consequent lower price and cheapness got into use for cloths of
estate over royal thrones, on common occasions, the shortened form of
such a regal emblem, the canopy hung over the high altar of a church,
acquired, and yet keeps its appellation, at least in Italy, of “baldachino.”</p>

<p>How very full in size, how costly in materials and embroidery, must
have sometimes been the cloth of estate spread overhead and behind the
throne of our kings, may be gathered from the “Privy Purse Expenses
of Henry the Seventh,” wherein this item comes: “To Antony<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lviii">[Pg lviii]</span>

<p>This same rich golden stuff asks for our notice under a third and even
better known name, to be found all through our early literature as</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Cloth of Pall.</span></h4>

<p>The cloak (in Latin pallium, in Anglo-Saxon paell) of state for regal
ceremonies and high occasions, worn alike by men as well as women,
was always made of the most gorgeous stuff that could be found. From
a very early period in the mediæval ages, golden webs shot in silk with
one or other of the various colours&mdash;occasionally blue, oftener crimson&mdash;were
sought out, as may be easily imagined, for the purpose, through so
many years, and everywhere, that at last each sort of cloth of gold had
given to it the name of “pall,” no matter the immediate purpose to
which it might have to be applied, and after so many fashions. Vestments
for church use and garments for knights and ladies were made of
it. Old St. Paul’s had chasubles and copes of cloth of pall: “Casula
de pal, capa chori de pal, &amp;c.”<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p>Hence, when Elizabeth, our Henry VII.’s queen, “proceeded from the
Towre throwge the Citie of London (for her coronation) to Westminster,
al the strets ther wich she shulde passe by, were clenly dressed and
besene with clothes of Tappestreye and Arras. And some strets, as
Cheepe, hangged with riche clothes of gold, velvetts, and silks, &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>
“As late as <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1555, at Bow chyrche in London was hangyd with
cloth of gold and with ryche hares (arras).”<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>Those same feelings which quickened our doughty knights and high-born
ladies to go and overspread the bier of each dead noble friend, with
costly baudekins or cloths of gold, so the church whispered and she
whispers us still to do, in due degree, the same to the coffin in which the
poor man is being carried to the grave beneath a mantle of silk and
velvet. The brother or the sister belonging to any of our old London
gilds had over them, however lowly they might have been in life, one or
other of those splendid hearse-cloths which we saw in this museum,
among the loans, in the ever memorable year 1862.</p>

<p>This silken textile interwove with gold, first known as “ciclatoun,”
on account of its glitter, then as “baudekin,” from the city where it was
best made, came at last to be called by the name of “pall.” Whether
employed on jubilant occasions, for a joyful betrothal, or a stately coronation,
or for a sorrowing funeral, it mattered not, it got the common
term of “cloth of pall,” which we yet keep up in that velvet covering
for a coffin, a burial pall.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Lettered Silks</span></h4>

<p>are of no uncommon occurrence, and some examples may be seen in this
collection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_lx">[Pg lx]</span></p>

<p>A celebrated Mohammedan writer, Ebn-Khaldoun, who died about
the middle of the fifteenth century, while speaking of that spot in an
Arab palace, the “Tiraz,” so designated from the name itself of the rich
silken stuffs therein woven, tells us that of the attributes of all Saracenic
kings and sultans, and which became a particular usage for ruling
dynasties, one was to have woven the name of the actual prince, or that
special ensign chosen by his house, into the stuffs intended for their personal
wear, whether wrought of silk, brocade, or even coarser kind of silk.
While gearing his loom, the workman contrived that the letters of the
title should come out either in threads of gold, or in silk of another colour
from that of the ground. The royal apparel thus bore about it its own
especial marks emblematic of the sultan’s wardrobe, and so became the
distinguishing ensigne of the prince himself, as well as for those personages
around him, who were allowed, by their official rank in his court, to
wear them, and those again upon whom he had condescended to bestow
such garments as especial tokens of the imperial favour, like the modern
pelisse of honour. Before the period of their having embraced Islamism
the Kings of Persia used to have woven upon the stuffs wrought for
their personal use, or as gifts to others, their own especial effigies or likeness,
or at times the peculiar ensign of their royalty. On becoming
Mussulmans, the rulers of that kingdom changed the custom, and instead
of portraiture substituted their names, to which they added words
sounding to their ears as foreboding good, or certain formulas of praise
and benediction.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> Wherever the Moslem ruled, there did he set up the
same practice; and thus, whether in Asia, in Egypt, or other parts of
Africa, or in Moorish Spain, the silken garments for royalty and its
favoured ones, showed woven in them the prince’s name, or at least his
chosen badge. The silken garments wrought in Egypt for the far-famed
Saladin, and worn by him as its Kalif, bore very conspicuously upon
them the name of that conqueror.</p>

<p>In our old lists of church ornaments, frequent mention is found
of vestments inscribed, like pieces here, with words in real or pretended
Arabic; and when St. Paul’s inventory more than once speaks of
silken stuffs, “de opere Saraceno,” we lean to the belief that, though
not all, some at least of those textiles were so called from having Arabic
characters woven on them. Such, too, were the letters on the red pall,
figured with elephants and a bird, belonging to Exeter: “Palla rubea
cum quibusdam literis et elephantis et quadam avi in superiori parte.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxi">[Pg lxi]</span><a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>
Later, our trade with the South of Spain and the Moors there, led us to
call such words on woven stuffs Moorish, as we find in old documents,
thus Joane Lady Bergavenny bequeaths (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1434) a “hullyng (hangings
for a hall) of black, red, and green, with morys letters, &amp;c.”<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p>The weaving of letters in textiles is neither a Moorish, nor Saracenic
invention; ages before, the ancient Parthians used to do so, as we learn
from Pliny: “Parthi literas vestibus intexunt.” A curious illustration
of silken stuffs so frequently bearing letters, borrowed in general from
some real or supposed oriental alphabet, is the custom which many of the
illuminators had of figuring very often on frontals and altar canopies,
made of silk, meaningless words; and the artists of Italy up to the middle
of the sixteenth century did the same on the hems of the garments worn
by great personages, in their paintings. On the inscribed textiles here,
the real or pretended Arabic sentence is written twice on the same line,
once forwards, once backwards.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Eagle</span>,</h4>

<p>single and double-headed, may frequently be found in the patterns of old
silks. In all ages certain birds of prey have been looked upon by heathens
as ominous for good or evil. Of this our own country affords us
a mournful example. Upon the standard which was carried at the head
of the Danish masters of Northumbria was figured the raven, the bird of
Odin. This banner had been woven and worked by the daughters of
Regnar Lodbrok, in one noontide’s while; and those heathens believed
that if victory was to follow, the raven would seem to stand erect, and
as if about to soar before the warriors, but if a defeat was impending, the
raven hung his head and drooped his wings; as we are told by Asser:
“Pagani acceperunt illud vexillum quod Reafan nominant: dicunt enim
quod tres sorores Hungari et Habbæ filiæ videlicet Lodebrochi illud
vexillum texuerunt et totum paraverunt illud uno meridiano tempore:
dicunt etiam quod, in omni bello ubi præcederet idem signum, si victoriam
adepturi essent, appereret in medio signi quasi corvus vivens volitans:
sin vero vincendi in futuro fuissent, penderet directe nihil movens.”<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>
Another and a more important flag, that which Harold and his Anglo-Saxons
fought under and lost at Hastings, is described by Malmesbury as
having been embroidered in gold, with the figure of a man in the act of
fighting, and studded with precious stones, all done in sumptuous art:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxii">[Pg lxii]</span></p>

<p>“Quod (vexillum) erat in hominis pugnantis figura auro et lapidibus
arte sumptuosa intextum.”<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>Still farther down in past ages, known for its daring and its lofty flight,
the eagle was held in high repute; throughout all the East, where it
became the emblem of lordly power and victory, often it is to be seen
flying in triumph over the head of some Assyrian conqueror, as may
be witnessed in Layard’s Work on Nineveh.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> Homer calls it the bird
of Jove. Upon the yoke in the war chariot of the Persian king Darius
sat perched an eagle as if outstretching his wings wrought all in gold:
“Auream aquilam pinnas extendenti similem.”<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> The sight of this bird in
the air while a battle raged was, by the heathen looked upon as an omen
boding victory to those on whose side it hovered. At the battle of Granicus
those about Alexander saw or thought they saw fluttering just above his
head, quite heedless of the din, an eagle, to which Aristander called the
attention of the Macedonians as an unmistakable earnest of success:
“Qui circa Alexandrum erant, vidisse se crediderunt, paululum super caput
regis placide volantem aquilam non gemitu morientium territam Aristander
... militibus in pugnam intentis avem monstrabat, haud dubium victoriæ
auspicium.”<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> The Romans bore it on their standards; the Byzantine
emperors kept it as their own device, and following the ancient traditions
of the east, and heedless of their law that forbids the making of images, the
Saracens, especially when they ruled in Egypt, had the eagle figured on
several things about them, sometimes single at others double-headed, which
latter was the shape adopted by the emperors of Germany as their blazon;
and in this form it is borne to this day by several reigning houses. No
wonder then that eagles of both fashions are so often to be observed
woven upon ancient and eastern textiles.</p>

<p>Very likely, as yet left to show itself upon the walls of the citadel at
Cairo, and those curious old glass lamps hung up there and elsewhere in
the mosques, the double-headed eagle with wings displayed, which we
find on royal Saracenic silks, was borrowed by the Paynim from the
Crusaders, as it would seem, and selected for its ensign by the government
of Egypt in the thirteenth century, which will easily account for the
presence of that heraldic bird upon so many specimens from Saracenic
looms, to be found in this collection. The “tiraz,” in fact, was for silk
like the royal manufactory of Dresden and Sèvres china, or Gobelin’s
looms for tapestry, and as the courts of France for its mark or ensign fixed
upon the two LLs interlaced, and the house of Saxony the two swords
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxiii">[Pg lxiii]</span>
placed saltire wise, so at least for Saladin and Egypt, in the middle ages
the double-headed eagle with its wings outstretched, was the especial
badge or ensign. In the same manner the sacred “horm,” or tree of life,
between the two rampant lions or cheetahs may be the mark of Persia.</p>

<p>As early as <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1277 Exeter Cathedral reckoned among her vestments
several such; for instance, a cope of baudekin figured with small two-headed
eagles: “Capa baudekyn cum parvis aquilis, ij capita habentibus;”<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>
and our Henry III.’s brother, Richard the king of Germany, gave to the
same church a cope of black baudekin, with eagles in gold figured on it:
“Una capa de baudek, nigra cum aquilis deauratis.”<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> Many other
instances might be noticed all through England.</p>

<p>As in architecture, sculpture, and painting, ancient and modern, so</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">In Woven Stuffs there are Styles nicely defined,
and Epochs easily discernible.</span></h3>

<p>Hitherto no attempt has been anywhere made to distribute olden silken
textiles into various schools, and as the present is the first and only
collection which has in any country been thrown open as yet to the
public, the occasion seems a fitting one to warrant such an endeavour
of classification.</p>

<p>With no other than the specimens here before us, we think we see
them fall into these several groups&mdash;Chinese, Persian, Byzantine, Oriental
or Indian, Syrian, Saracenic, Moresco-Spanish, Sicilian, Italian, Flemish,
British, and French.</p>

<p><i>Chinese</i> examples here are very few; but what they are, whether plain
or figured, they are beautiful in their own way. From all that we know
of the people, we are led to believe their own way two thousand years ago
is precisely theirs still, so that the web wrought by them this year or two
hundred years ago, like <a href="#h-1368">No. 1368</a>, p. 75, would not differ hardly in a
line from their textiles two thousand years gone by, when Dionysius
Periegetes wrote that, the “Seres make precious figured garments,
resembling in colour the flowers of the field, and rivalling in fineness
the work of spiders.” In the stuffs, warp and woof are of silk, and both
of the best kinds.</p>

<p><i>Persian</i> textiles, even as we see them in this collection, must have been
for many centuries just as they were ever figured, and may be, even now,
described by the words of Quintus Curtius, with some little allowance for
those influences exercised upon the mind of the weaver by his peculiar
religious belief, which would not let the lowliest workman forget the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxiv">[Pg lxiv]</span>
“homa,” or tree of life. When Marco Polo travelled through those
parts, in the thirteenth century, and our countryman, Sir John Mandeville,
a hundred years later, the old love for hunting wild beasts still lived, and
the princes of the country were as fond as ever of training the cheetah,
a kind of small lion or leopard, for the chase, as we have noticed, <a href="#Page_178">p. 178</a>.</p>

<p>When the design is made up of various kinds of beasts and birds, real
or imaginary, with the sporting cheetah nicely spotted among them; and
the “homa” conspicuously set forth above all; sure may we be that the
web was wrought by Persians, and on most occasions the textile will be
found in all its parts to be woven from the richest materials.</p>

<p>As an illustration of the Persian type of style, <a href="#h-8233">No. 8233</a>, p. 154, may
be taken as a specimen.</p>

<p>For trade purposes, and to make the textile pass in the European
market as from Persia, the manner of its loom was often copied by the
Jewish and the Christian weavers in Syria, as we shall have to notice
just now.</p>

<p><i>The Byzantine</i> Greeks, for their textiles from the time when in the
sixth century they began to weave home-grown silk, made for themselves
a school of design which kept up in their drawing not a little of the
beauty, breadth, and flowing outline which had outlived among them the
days of heathenish art. Along with this a strong feeling of their
Christianity showed itself as well in many of the subjects which they took
out of holy writ, as in the smaller elements of ornamentation. Figures,
whether of the human form or of beasts, are given in a much larger and
bolder size than on any other ancient stuffs. Though there be very few
known specimens from the old looms of Constantinople, the one here,
<a href="#h-7036">No. 7036</a>, p. 122, showing Samson wrestling with a lion, may serve as a
type. In the year 1295 old St. Paul’s Cathedral, here in London, would
seem to have possessed several splendid vestments made of Byzantine silk,
as we note in the samples to be named <i>infra</i> under the head of
Damask.</p>

<p>The way in which those Greeks gave a pattern to the stuff intended
more especially for liturgical purposes is pointed out while speaking about
“Stauracin” and the “Gammadion,” a form of the cross with which
they powdered their silks; <a href="#Page_lii">p. lii.</a></p>

<p>The world-wide fame of the Byzantine purple tint is attested by our
Gerald Barry, whose words we quote further on. As a sample of the
Byzantine loom in “diaspron,” or diapering, we would refer to <a href="#h-1239">No. 1239</a>,
p. 26.</p>

<p>The specimens here from the Byzantine, and later Greek loom, are
not to be taken as by any means appropriate samples of its general production.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxv">[Pg lxv]</span>
They are poor in both respects&mdash;material and, when figured,
design&mdash;as may be seen at pp. <a href="#Page_27">27</a>, <a href="#Page_28">28</a>, <a href="#Page_33">33</a>, <a href="#Page_36">36</a>, <a href="#Page_123">123</a>, <a href="#Page_124">124</a>, <a href="#Page_126">126</a>, <a href="#Page_219">219</a>, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Oriental</i> ancient silks and textiles have their own distinctive marks.</p>

<p>From Marco Polo, who wandered much over the far east, some time
during the thirteenth century, we learn that the weaving there was done
by women who wrought in silk and gold, after a noble manner, beasts
and birds upon their webs:&mdash;“Le loro donne lavorano tutte cose a seta
e ad oro e a uccelli e a bestie nobilmente e lavorano di cortine ed altre
cose molto ricamente.”<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<p>Out of the several specimens here from Tartary and India, during our
mediæval period, we pick one or two which show well the meaning of
those words uttered by that great Venetian traveller, while speaking about
the textiles he saw in those countries. The dark purple piece of silk,
figured in gold with birds and beasts, of the thirteenth century, <a href="#h-7086">No. 7086</a>,
p. 137, is good; but better still for our purpose is the shred, <a href="#h-7087">No. 7087</a>,
p. 138, of blue damask, with its birds, its animals, and flowers
wrought in gold, and different coloured silks.</p>

<p>What India is, it has ever been, famous for its cloud-like transparent
muslins, which since Marco Polo’s days have kept till now even that
oriental name, through being better than elsewhere woven at Mosul.</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Syrian</i> school is well represented here by several fine pieces.</p>

<p>The whole sea-board of that part of Asia Minor, as well as far inland,
was inhabited by a mixture of Jews, Christians, and Saracens; and each
of these people were workers in silk. The reputation of the neighbouring
Persia had of old stood high for the beauty and durability of her
silken textiles, which made them to be sought for by the European
traders. Persia’s outlet to the west for her goods, lay through the great
commercial ports on the coast of Syria. Setting, like Persia used to do,
as it were, her own peculiar seal upon her figured webs, by mingling in
her designs the mystic “homa,” to the European mind this part of the
pattern became, at first, a sort of assurance that those goods had been thrown
off by Persian looms. By one of those tricks of imitation followed then, as
well as now, the Syrian designers for the loom threw this “homa” into
their patterns. This symbol of “the tree of life,” had no doubt been a
borrow by Zoroaster from Holy Writ.<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> Neither to the Christian’s eye,
nor to the Jew’s, nor Moslem’s, was there in it anything objectionable;
all three, therefore, took it and made it a leading portion of design in the
patterns of their silks; and hence is it that we meet it so often. Though
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxvi">[Pg lxvi]</span>
done with perhaps a fraudulent intention of palming on the world Syrian
for real Persian silks, those Syrians usually put into their own designs a
something which spoke of their peculiar selves and their workmanship.
Though there be seen the “homa,” the “cheetah,” and other elements
of Persian patterns, still the discordant two-handled vase, the badly imitated
Arabic sentence, betray the textile to be not Persian, but Syrian.
<a href="#h-8359">No. 8359</a>, p. 213, will readily exemplify our meaning. Furthermore,
perhaps quite innocent of any knowledge about Persia’s first belief, and
her use of the “homa” in her old religious services, the Christian
weavers of Syria, along with the Zorasterian symbol, put the sign of the
cross by the side of that “tree of life,” as we find upon the piece of silk,
<a href="#h-7094">No. 7094</a>, p. 140. Another remarkable specimen of the Syrian loom is
<a href="#h-7034">No. 7034</a>, p. 122, whereon the Nineveh lions come forth so conspicuously.
As a good example of well-wrought “diaspron” or diaper, <a href="#h-8233">No. 8233</a>,
p. 154, may be mentioned, along with <a href="#h-7052">No. 7052</a>, p. 127.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_224" href="#FNanchor_224" class="label">[224]</a> Genesis ii. 9.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Saracenic</i> weaving, as shown by the design upon the web, is exemplified
in several specimens before us.</p>

<p>However much against what looks like a heedlessness of the Koran’s
teachings, certain it is that the Saracens, those of the upper classes in
particular, felt no difficulty in wearing robes upon which animals and
the likenesses of other created things were woven; with the strictest of
their princes, a double-headed eagle was a royal heraldic device, as we
have shown, <a href="#Page_lxiii">p. lxiii</a>. Stuffs, then, figured with birds and beasts, with trees
and flowers, were not the less of Saracenic workmanship, and meant for
Moslem wear. What, however, may be looked for upon real Saracenic
textures is a pattern consisting of longitudinal stripes of blue, red, green,
and other colour; some of them charged with animals, small in form,
other some written, in large Arabic letters, with a word or sentence,
often a proverb, often a good wish or some wise saw.</p>

<p>As examples we would point to <a href="#h-8288">No. 8288</a>, p. 178, and <a href="#h-7051">7051</a>, p. 127.
For a fair specimen of diapering, <a href="#h-7050">No. 7050</a>, p. 127, while <a href="#h-8639">No. 8639</a>,
p. 243, presents us with a design having in it, besides the crescent moon,
a proof that architectural forms were not forgotten by the weaver-draughtsman,
in his sketches for the loom.</p>

<p>Later, in our chapter on Tapestry, we shall have occasion to speak
about another sort of Saracenic work or tapestry, of the kind called
abroad, from the position of its frame, of the basse lisse.</p>

<p><i>Moresco-Spanish</i>, or Saracenic textiles, wrought in Spain, though partaking
of the striped pattern, and bearing words in real or imitated
Arabic, had some distinctions of their own. The designs shown upon
these stuffs are almost always drawn out of strap-work, reticulations, or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxvii">[Pg lxvii]</span>
some combination or another of geometrical lines, amid which are occasionally
to be found different forms of conventional flowers. Specimens
are to be seen here at pp. <a href="#Page_51">51</a>, <a href="#Page_55">55</a>, <a href="#Page_121">121</a>, <a href="#Page_124">124</a>, <a href="#Page_125">125</a>, <a href="#Page_186">186</a>, <a href="#Page_240">240</a>, &amp;c. Sometimes,
but very rarely, the crescent moon is figured as in the curious piece,
<a href="#h-8639">No. 8639</a>, p. 243. The colours of these silks are usually either a fine
crimson, or a deep blue with almost always a fine toned yellow as a
ground. But one remarkable feature in these Moresco-Spanish textiles
is the presence, when gold is brought in, of an ingenious though
fraudulent imitation of the precious metal, for which shreds of gilded
parchment cut up into narrow flat strips are substituted, and woven with
the silk. This, when fresh, must have looked very bright, and have
given the web all the appearance of those favourite stuffs called here in
England “tissues,” of which we have already spoken, <a href="#Page_xxiii">p. xxiii</a>.</p>

<p>We are not aware that this trick has ever been found out before, and
it was only by the use of a highly magnifying glass that we penetrated the
secret. Our suspicion was awakened by so often observing that the gold
had become quite black. Examples of this gilt vellum may be seen here,
at Nos. <a href="#h-7095">7095</a>, p. 140; <a href="#h-8590">8590</a>, p. 224; <a href="#h-8639">8639</a>, p. 244; &amp;c.</p>

<p>When the Christian Spanish weavers lived beyond Saracenic control,
they filled their designs with beasts, birds, and flowers; but even then
the old Spanish fine tone of crimson is rather striking in their webs, as
is evidenced in the beautiful piece of diaper, <a href="#h-1336">No. 1336</a>, p. 64.</p>

<p>Spanish velvets&mdash;and they were mostly wrought in Andalusia&mdash;are remarkably
fine and conspicuous both for their deep soft pile, and their glowing
ruby tones; but when woven after the manner of velvet upon velvet,
are very precious: a good specimen of rich texture, and mellow colouring
is furnished by the chasuble at <a href="#h-1375">No. 1375</a>, p. 81.</p>

<p>The <i>Sicilian</i> school strongly marked the wide differences between itself
and all the others which had lived before; and the history of its loom is
as interesting as it is varied.</p>

<p>The first to teach the natives of Sicily the use of cotton for their garments,
and how to rear the silkworm and spin its silk, were, as it would
seem, the Mahomedans, who, in coming over from Africa, brought along
with them, besides the art of weaving silken textiles, a knowledge of the
fauna of that vast continent&mdash;its giraffes, its antelopes, its gazelles, its
lions, its elephants. These Mussulmans told them, too, of the parrots of
India and the hunting sort of lion,&mdash;the cheetahs, that were found in
Asia; and when the stuff had to be wrought for European wear, imaged
both beast and bird upon the web, at the same time that they wove a
word in Arabic, of greeting to be read among the flowers. Like all other
Saracens, those in Sicily loved to mingle gold in their tissues; and, to spare
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxviii">[Pg lxviii]</span>
the silk, cotton thread was not unfrequently worked up in the warp.
When, therefore, we meet with beasts taken from the fauna of Africa,
such, especially, as the giraffe, and the several classes of the antelope
family&mdash;in particular the gazelle&mdash;with, somewhere about, an Arabic
motto&mdash;and part of the pattern wrought in gold, which, at first poor and
thin, is now become black, as well as cotton in the warp, we may fairly
take the specimen as a piece of Sicily’s work in its first period of
weaving, all so Saracenic to the eye. Even when that Moslem nation had
been driven out by the Normans, if many of its people did not stay as
workmen in silk at Palermo, yet they left their teachings in weaving and
design behind them, and their practices were, years afterwards, still followed.</p>

<p>Now we reach Sicily’s second epoch.</p>

<p>While at war with the Byzantines, in the twelfth century, Roger,
King of Sicily, took Corinth, Thebes, and Athens, from each of which
cities he led away captives all the men and women he could find who
knew how to weave silks, and carried them to Palermo. To the Norman
tiraz there, these Grecian new comers brought fresh designs, which were
adopted sometimes wholly, at others but in part and mixed up with the
older Saracenic style, for silks wrought under the Normano-Sicilian
dynasty. In this second period of the island’s loom we discover what
traces the Byzantine school had impressed upon Sicilian silks, and helped
so much to alter the type of their design. On one silk, a grotesque mask
amid the graceful twinings of luxuriant foliage, such as might have been
then found by them upon many a fragment of old Greek sculpture, was
the pattern, as we witness, at <a href="#h-8241">No. 8241</a>, p. 158; on another, a sovereign
on horseback wearing the royal crown, and carrying as he rides a hawk
upon his wrist&mdash;token both of the love for lordly sports at the period,
and the feudalism all over Italy and Christendom, shown in the piece,
<a href="#h-8589">No. 8589</a>, p. 223; on a third, <a href="#h-8234">No. 8234</a>, p. 154, is the Greek cross,
along with a pattern much like the old netted or “de fundato” kind
which we have described, <a href="#Page_lii">p. liii</a>.</p>

<p>But Sicily’s third is quite her own peculiar style. At the end of the
thirteenth and beginning of the fourteenth century, she struck out of herself
into quite an unknown path for design. Without throwing aside the
old elements employed till then especially, all over the east, and among
the rest, by the Mahomedans, Sicily put along with them the emblem of
Christianity, the cross, in various forms, on some occasions with the letter
V. four times repeated, and so placed together as to fall into the shape of
this symbol, like what we find at <a href="#h-1245">No. 1245</a>, p. 28; in other instances the
cross is floriated, as at <a href="#h-1293">No. 1293</a>, p. 47.</p>

<p>From the far east to the uttermost western borders of the Mediterranean
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxix">[Pg lxix]</span>
the weavers of every country had been in the habit of figuring upon their
silks those beasts and birds they saw around them: the Tartar, the
Indian, and the Persian gave us the parrot and the cheetah; the men of
Africa the giraffe and the gazelle; the people of each continent the lions,
the elephants, the eagles, and the other birds common to both. From
the poetry and sculpture of the Greeks and Romans could the Sicilians
have easily learned about the fabled griffin and the centaur; but
it was left for their own wild imaginings to figure as they have, such an
odd compound in one being as the animal&mdash;half elephant, half griffin&mdash;which
we see in <a href="#h-1288">No. 1288</a>, p. 45. Their daring flights of fancy in
coupling the difficult with the beautiful, are curious; in one place, <a href="#h-1302">No. 1302</a>,
p. 50, large eagles are perched in pairs with a radiating sun between
them, and beneath dogs, in pairs, running with heads turned back, &amp;c.;
in another, <a href="#h-1304">No. 1304</a>, p. 51, running harts have caught one of their hind
legs in a cord tied to their collar, and an eagle swoops down upon them;
and the same animal, in another place, on the same piece has switched its
tail into the last link of a chain fastened to its neck; on a third sample,
<a href="#h-8588">No. 8588</a>, p. 222, we behold figured, harts, the letter M floriated,
winged lions, crosses floriated, crosses sprouting out on two sides with
<i>fleurs-de-lis</i>, four-legged monsters, some like winged lions, some biting
their tails. Exeter Cathedral had a cloth of gold purple cope, figured
with “draconibus volantibus ac tenentibus caudas proprias in ore,”<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>
doves in pairs upholding a cross, &amp;c. Hardly elsewhere to be found are
certain elements peculiar to the patterns upon silks from mediæval
Sicily; such, for instance, as harts, and demi-dogs with very large wings,
both animals having remarkably long manes streaming far behind them,
<a href="#h-1279">No. 1279</a>, p. 41; harts again, but lodged beneath green trees, in a park
with paling about it, as in <a href="#h-1283">No. 1283</a>, p. 43, and <a href="#h-8710">No. 8710</a>, p. 269; that
oft-recurring sun shedding its beams with eagles pecking at them, or
gazing undazzled at the luminary, pp. <a href="#Page_48">48</a>, <a href="#Page_50">50</a>, <a href="#Page_137">137</a>, but sometimes stags,
as at pp. <a href="#Page_54">54</a>, <a href="#Page_239">239</a>, carrying their well attired heads upturned to a large
pencil of those sunbeams as they dart down upon them amid a shower of
rain-drops. Of birds, the hawk, the eagle, double and single headed, the
parrot, may be found on stuffs all over the east; not so, however, with the
swan, yet this majestic creature was a favourite with Sicilians, and may
be seen here often drawn with great gracefulness, as at Nos. <a href="#h-1277">1277</a>, p. 41;
<a href="#h-1299">1299</a>, p. 49; <a href="#h-8264">8264</a>, p. 166; <a href="#h-8610">8610</a>, p. 232, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_225" href="#FNanchor_225" class="label">[225]</a> Oliver, p. 345.</p>

</div>

<p>The Sicilians showed their strong affection for certain plants and
flowers. On a great many of the silks in this collection, from Palermitan
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxx">[Pg lxx]</span>
looms, we see figured upon a tawny-coloured grounding, beautifully
drawn foliage in green; which, on a nearer inspection, bears the
likeness of parsley, so curled, crispy and serrated are its leaves. Besides
their cherished parsley along with the vine-leaf for foliage, they had their
especial favourite among flowers; and it is the centaurea cyanus, our
corn blue-bottle, shown among others in No. <a href="#h-1283">1283</a>, &amp;c. p. 43, No.
<a href="#h-1291">1291</a>, p. 47, No. <a href="#h-1308">1308</a>, p. 53.</p>

<p>Another peculiarity of theirs is the introduction of the letter U,
repeated so as at times to mark the feathering upon the tails of birds;
at others, to fall into the shape of an O, as we pointed out at pp. <a href="#Page_40">40</a>, <a href="#Page_225">225</a>,
<a href="#Page_227">227</a>, <a href="#Page_228">228</a>.</p>

<p>Whether it was that, like our own Richard I., crusaders in after
times often made Sicily the halting spot on their way to the Holy Land,
or that knights crowded there for other purposes, and thus dazzled the eyes
of the islanders with the bravery of their armorial bearings, figured on
their cyclases and pennons, their flags and shields, certain is it that these
Sicilians were particularly given to introduce a deal of heraldic charges&mdash;wyverns,
eagles, lions rampant, and griffins&mdash;into their designs; and
the very numerous occasions in which such elements of blazoning come
in, are very noticeable, so that one of the features belonging to the
Sicilian loom in its third period, is that, bating tinctures, it is so decidedly
heraldic.</p>

<p>Not the last among the peculiarities of the third period in the Sicilian
school is the use, for many of its stuffs, of two certain colours&mdash;murrey,
for the ground, and a bright green for the pattern. When the
fawn-coloured ground is gracefully sprinkled with parsley leaves, and
nicely trailed with branches of the vine, and shows beasts and birds
disporting themselves between the boughs of lively joyous green; the
effect is cheerful, as may be witnessed in those specimens No. <a href="#h-8594">8594</a>, p.
226, No. <a href="#h-8602">8602</a>, p. 229, No. <a href="#h-8607">8607</a>, p. 231, Nos. <a href="#h-8609">8609</a>, <a href="#h-8610">8610</a>, p. 232,
all of which so admirably exemplify the style.</p>

<p>All their beauty and happiness of invention, set forth by bold, free,
spirited drawing, were bestowed, if not thrown away, too often upon
stuffs of a very poor inferior quality, in which the gold, if not actually
base, was always scanty, and a good deal of cotton was sure to be found
wrought up along with the silk.</p>

<p>Though Palermo was, without doubt, the great workshop for
weaving Sicilian silks, that trade used to be carried on not only in other
cities of the island, but reached towns like Reggio and other such in
Magna Græcia, northward up to Naples. We think that, as far as the
two Sicilies are concerned, the growth of the cotton plant always went
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxxi">[Pg lxxi]</span>
along with the rearing of the silkworm. Of the main-land loom we
would specify No. <a href="#h-8256">8256</a>, p. 163, No. <a href="#h-8634">8634</a>, p. 242, No. <a href="#h-8638">8638</a>, p. 243.</p>

<p>Till within a few years the royal manufactory at Sta. Leucia, near
Naples, produced silks of remarkable richness; and the piece, likely
from that city itself, No. <a href="#h-721">721</a>, p. 13, does credit to its loom, as it wove
in the seventeenth century. Northern Italy was not idle; and the looms
which she set up in several of her great cities, in Lucca, Florence,
Genoa, Venice and Milan, earned apart for themselves a good
repute in some particulars, and a wide trade for their gold and silver
tissues, their velvets, and their figured silken textiles. Yet, like as each
of these free states had its own accent and provincialisms in speech, so
too had it a something often thrown into its designs and style of drawing
which told of the place and province whence the textiles came.</p>

<p><i>Lucca</i> at an early period made herself known in Europe for her
textiles; but her draughtsmen, like those of Sicily, seem to have thought
themselves bound to follow the style hitherto in use, brought by the
Saracens, of figuring parrots and peacocks, gazelles, and even cheetahs,
as we behold in the specimens here No. <a href="#h-8258">8258</a>, p. 163, and No. <a href="#h-8616">8616</a>, p.
234. But, at the same time, along with these eastern animals, she mixed
up emblems of her own, such as angels clothed in white, like in the
example the last mentioned. She soon dropped what was oriental from
her patterns, which she began to draw in a larger, bolder manner, as we
observe, under No. <a href="#h-8637">8637</a>, p. 243, No. <a href="#h-8640">8640</a>, p. 244, and showing
an inclination for light blue, as a colour.</p>

<p>As in other places abroad, so at Lucca, cloths of gold and of silver
were often wrought, and the Lucchese cloths of this costly sort were,
here in England, during the fourteenth century, in particular request.
In all likelihood they were, both of them, not of the deadened but
sparkling kind, afterwards especially known as “tissue.” Exeter Cathedral,
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1327, had a cope of silver tissue, or cloth of Lucca:&mdash;“una
capa alba de panno de Luk.”<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> At a later date, belonging to the
same church, were two fine chasubles&mdash;one purple, the other red&mdash;of the
same glittering stuff, “casula de purpyll panno,” &amp;c.,<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> where we find
it specified that not only was the textile of gold, but of that especial
sort called tissue. York cathedral was particularly furnished with a
great many copes of tissue shot with every colour required by its ritual,
and among them were&mdash;“a reade cope of clothe of tishewe with orphry
of pearl, a cope with orphrey, a cope of raised clothe of goulde,”<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>
making a distinction between tissue and the ordinary cloth of gold.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxxii">[Pg lxxii]</span>
But at the court of our Edward II. its favour would seem to have been
the highest. In the Wardrobe Accounts of that king, we see the golden
tissue, or Lucca cloth, several times mentioned. Whether the ceremony
happened to be sad or gay, this glistening web was used; palls made of
Lucca cloth were, at masses for the dead, strewed over the corpse; at
marriages the care-cloth was made of the same stuff; thus when Richard
de Arundell and Isabella, Hugh le Despenser’s daughter, had been wedded
at the door of the royal chapel, the veil held spread out over their heads
as they knelt inside the chancel during the nuptial mass, for the blessing,
was of Lucca cloth.<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> Richard II.’s fondness for this cloth of gold was
lately noticed, p. <a href="#Page_xxx">xxx</a>.</p>

<p>Just about Edward II.’s time was it that velvet became known, and
got into use amongst our churchmen for vestments, and our nobles for
personal wear, and the likelihood is that Lucca was among the first
places in Europe to weave it. The specimens here of this fine textile
from Lucchese looms, though in comparison with those from Genoa, they
be few and mostly after one manner&mdash;the raised or cut&mdash;still have now a
certain historical value for the English workman: No. <a href="#h-1357">1357</a>, p. 72, with
its olive green plain silken ground, and trailed all over with flowers and
leaves in a somewhat deeper tone, and the earlier example, No. <a href="#h-8322">8322</a>, p.
192, with its ovals and feathering stopped with graceful cusps and artichokes,
afford us good instances of what Lucca could produce in the way
of artistic velvets.</p>

<p><i>Genoa</i>, though in far off mediæval times not so conspicuous as she
afterwards became for her textile industry, still must have from a remote
period, encouraged within her walls, and over her narrow territory, the
weaving of silken webs. Of these the earliest mention we anywhere
find, is to be seen in the inventory of those costly vestments once belonging
to our own St. Paul’s Cathedral, London, in the year 1295: besides
a cope of Genoa cloth, that church had, from the same place, a
hanging patterned with wheels and two-headed birds.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> Though this first
description be scant, we read in it quite enough to gather that these
Genoese cloths must have entirely resembled the textiles wrought at
Lucca, but, in particular, in Sicily. Perhaps they had been carried by trade
from Palermo to the north-west shores of Italy, whence they were
brought in the same way to England, so that they may be deemed to have
reached us not so much from the looms themselves of Genoa, as those of
some other place, but through her then great port.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxxiii">[Pg lxxiii]</span></p>

<p>Of Genoa’s own weaving of beautiful velvets there can be no doubt, a
reputation she keeps to the present day as far as plain velvet is concerned.</p>

<p>In this collection we have samples in every kind of Genoese velvets,
from those with a smooth unbroken surface to the elaborately patterned
ones&mdash;art-wrought velvets in fact&mdash;showing, together with wonderful
skill in the weaving, much beauty of design. Among the plain velvets
in which we have nothing but great softness and depth of pile, along with
clear bright luminous tones of colour, No. <a href="#h-540">540</a>, p. 3, is a very fair specimen
for its delicious richness of pile; and No. <a href="#h-8334">8334</a>, p. 199, not merely for
this property, but as well for its lightsome mellow deep tint of crimson.</p>

<p>Getting to what may be truly called art-velvets, we come to several
specimens here. Some are raised or cut, the design being done in a pile
standing well up by itself from out of a flat ground of silk, sometimes of
the same, sometimes of another colour, and not unfrequently wrought in
gold, as at pp. <a href="#Page_18">18</a>, <a href="#Page_90">90</a>, <a href="#Page_107">107</a>, <a href="#Page_110">110</a>, <a href="#Page_263">263</a>. Then we have at No. <a href="#h-7795">7795</a>, p.
145, an example of that precious kind&mdash;velvet upon velvet&mdash;in which the
ground is velvet, and again of velvet is the pattern itself, but raised one
pile higher and well above the other, so as to show its form and shape
distinctly. Last of all we here find samples, as in No. <a href="#h-8323">8323</a>, p. 192, how
the design was done in various coloured velvet. Such was a favourite in
England, and called motley; in his will, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1415, Henry Lord Scrope
bequeathed two vestments, one, motley velvet rubeo de auro; the other,
motley velvet nigro, rubeo et viridi, &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<p><i>Venice</i> does not seem to have been at any time, like Sicily and Lucca,
smitten with the taste of imitating in her looms at home the patterns
which she saw abroad upon textile fabrics, but appears to have borrowed
from the Orientals only one kind of weaving cloth of gold: the yellow
chasuble at Exeter Cathedral, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1327, figured with beasts, cum bestiis
crocei coloris,<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> is the solitary instance we know, upon which she wove,
like the east, animals upon silks. She, however, set up for herself a new
branch of textiles, and wrought for church use certain square webs of a
crimson ground on which she figured, in gold, or on yellow silk, subjects
taken from the New Testament, or the persons of saints and angels.
These square pieces were as they yet are, employed, when sewed together
in squares as frontals to altars, but when longwise much more generally
as orphreys to chasubles, copes and other vestments. Of such stuffs
must have been those large orphreys upon a dalmatic and tunicle, at St.
Paul’s Cathedral, London, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1295.
<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<p>Though not of so early a date as the thirteenth century, there are in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxxiv">[Pg lxxiv]</span>
this collection specimens of this Venetian web belonging to the sixteenth,
which are very fine, No. <a href="#h-5900">5900</a>, p. 112, represents the resurrection of our
Lord; so does No. <a href="#h-8976">8976</a>, p. 271, while No. <a href="#h-8978">8978</a>, p. 272, presents us
with the coronation of the Virgin, and No. <a href="#h-8976">8976</a>, the Virgin and the
Child, as also No. <a href="#h-1335">1335</a>, p. 71. Far below in worth are the same kind of
webs wrought at Cologne, as will be noticed just now.</p>

<p>Any one that has ever looked upon the woodcuts done at Venice in the
sixteenth century, such as illustrate, for instance, the Roman Pontifical,
published by Giunta, the “Rosario della G. V. Maria,” by Varisco, and
other such religious books from the Venetian press, will, at a glance, find
on the webs before us from that state, the self-same style and manner in
drawing, the same broad, nay, majestic fold and fall of drapery, and in the
human form the same plumpness, and not unfrequently with the facial
line almost straight; and there, but more especially about the hands and
feet, a somewhat naturalistic shape; so near is the likeness in design that
one is led to think that the men who cut the blocks for the printers also
worked for the weavers of Venice, and sketched out the drawings for
their looms.</p>

<p>By the fifteenth century Venice knew how to produce good damasks
in silk and gold, and of an historiated kind: if we had nothing more than
the specimen, No. <a href="#h-1311">1311</a>, p. 54, where St. Mary of Egypt is so well represented,
it would be quite enough for her to claim for herself such a distinction.
That like her neighbours, Venice wrought in velvet, there can
be little or no doubt, and if she it was who made those deep piled stuffs,
sometimes raised, sometimes pile upon pile, in which her painters loved to
dress the personages, men especially, in their pictures, then, of a truth,
Venetian velvets were beautiful. Of this, any one may satisfy himself by
one visit to our National Gallery. There, in the “Adoration of the
Magi,” painted by Paulo Veronese, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1573, the second of the wise
men is clad in a robe all made of crimson velvet, cut or raised after a
design quite in keeping with the style of the period.</p>

<p>No insignificant article of Venetian textile workmanship was her laces
wrought in every variety&mdash;in gold, in silk, in thread. The portrait of a
Doge usually shows us that dignitary clothed in his dress of state. His
wide mantle, having such large golden buttons, is made of some rich dull
silver cloth; and upon his head is that curiously Phrygian-shaped ducal
cap bound round with broad gold lace diapered after some nice pattern, as
we see in the bust portrait of Doge Loredano, painted by John Bellini,
and now in our National Gallery. Not only was the gold in the thread
particularly good, but the lace itself in great favour at our court during
one time, where it used to be bought, not by yard measure, but by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxxv">[Pg lxxv]</span>
weight; a pounde and a half of gold of Venys was employed “aboutes
the making of a lace and botons for the king’s mantell of the garter.”
<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>
“Frenge of Venys gold,” appears twice, pp. 136, 163, in the wardrobe
accounts of Edward IV.</p>

<p>Laces in worsted or in linen thread wrought by the bobbin at Venice;
but more especially her point laces, or such as were done with the needle,
always had, as indeed they still have, a great reputation: sewed to table-covers,
two specimens are found in this collection, described at p. <a href="#Page_141">141</a>.</p>

<p>Venetian linens, for fine towelling and napery in general, at one time
were in favourite use in France during a part of the fifteenth century.
In the “Ducs de Bourgogne,” by Le Comte de Laborde,<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> more than
once we meet with such an entry, as “une pièce de nappes, ouvraige de
Venise,” &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Florence</i>, always so industrious and art-loving, got for its loom, about
the middle of the fourteenth century, a place in the foremost rank amid
the weavers of northern Italy. Specimens of her earliest handicraft are
yet few&mdash;only two&mdash;here; but one sample of the able way in which she
knew how to diaper, well shows her ability: No. <a href="#h-8563">8563</a>, p. 215, woven in
the fifteenth century, will prove this with reference to her secular silks.
The pieces described at pp. <a href="#Page_202">202</a>, <a href="#Page_264">264</a>, witness the boldness of her design
during the sixteenth century. In her webs, expressly woven for church-use,
is it that she displays her great taste in design, and wonderful power&mdash;at
least for that time, the fourteenth century&mdash;in gearing the loom: the
violet silk damask, No. <a href="#h-1265">1265</a>, p. 36, and another like piece, No. <a href="#h-7072">7072</a>, p.
133, figured with angels swinging thuribles, or bearing crowns of thorns
in the hands, or holding a cross, will warrant our remarks. The style of
doing the face and hands in white of those otherwise yellow angels, is a
peculiarity of the Tuscan loom.</p>

<p>The orphrey-webs of Florence are equally conspicuous for drawing
and skill in weaving as her vestment textiles, and in beauty come up to
those done at Venice, and far surpass anything of the kind ever wrought
at Cologne; specimens of this sort of Florentine work may be seen at
Nos. <a href="#h-4059">4059</a>, p. 89; <a href="#h-7080">7080</a>, p. 136; <a href="#h-7674">7674</a>, p. 142; <a href="#h-7791">7791</a>, p. 143; <a href="#h-197">197</a>,
p. 291. Along with these may be classed the hood of a cope, described at
No. <a href="#h-8692">8692</a>, p. 260, as well as the apparels to the dalmatic and tunicle, p.
<a href="#Page_143">143</a>, where the cherubic heads have white faces.</p>

<p>But it was of her velvets that Florence might be so warrantably proud.
Our Henry VII. in his will, “Testamenta Vetusta,”<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> bequeathed “to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxxvi">[Pg lxxvi]</span>
God and St. Peter, and to the abbot and prior and convent of our monastery
of Westminster, the whole suit of vestments to be made at Florence
in Italy.” Gorgeous and artistically designed was this textile, as we may
yet see in one of these Westminster Abbey copes still in existence, and
belonging to Stonyhurst college. The golden ground is trailed all over
with leaf-bearing boughs of a bold type, in raised or cut ruby-toned velvet
of a rich soft pile, which is freckled with gold thread sprouting up like
loops. Though nothing so rich in material, nor so beauteous in pattern,
there are here, pp. <a href="#Page_144">144</a>, <a href="#Page_145">145</a>, two specimens of Florentine cut, crimson
velvet on a golden ground, quite like in sort to the royal vestments, and
having too that strong peculiarity upon them&mdash;the little gold thread loop
shooting out of the velvet pile. Though a full century later than the
splendid cope at Stonyhurst, and the two pieces Nos. <a href="#h-7792">7792</a>, <a href="#h-7799">7799</a>, these
illustrate the peculiar style of Tuscan velvets.</p>

<p>Among the truly prince-like gifts of vestments to Lincoln Cathedral, by
John of Gaunt and his duchess, are many made of the richest crimson velvet
of both sorts, that is, plain, and cut or raised to a pattern upon a ground
of gold, as for instance:&mdash;two red copes, of the which one is red velvet set
with white harts lying in colours, full of these letters S. S., with pendents
silver and gilt, the harts having crowns upon their necks with chains
silver and gilt; and the other cope is of crimson velvet of precious cloth
of gold, with images in the orphrey, &amp;c.
<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<p>That peculiar sort of ornamentation&mdash;the little loop of gold thread
standing well up, and in single spots&mdash;upon some velvets, seems at times
to have been replaced, perhaps with the needle, by small dots of solid
metal, gold or silver gilt, upon the pile; of the gift of one of its bishops,
John Grandisson, Exeter cathedral had a crimson velvet cope, the
purple velvet orphrey to which was so wrought:&mdash;De purpyll velvete

<p><i>Milan</i>, though now-a-days she stands in such high repute for the richness
and beauty of her silks of all sorts, was not, we believe, at any period
during mediæval times, as famous for her velvets, her brocades, or cloths
of gold, as for her well wrought admirably fashioned armour, so strong and
trustworthy for the field&mdash;so furbished and exquisitely damascened for
courtly service. Still, in the sixteenth century she earned a name for her rich
cut velvets, as we may see in the specimen, No. <a href="#h-698">698</a>, p. 7; her silken
net-work, No. <a href="#h-8336">8336</a>, p. 200, which may have led the way to weaving silk
stockings; and her laces of the open tinsel kind once in such vogue for
liturgical, as well as secular attire, as we have in No. <a href="#h-8331">8331</a>, p. 197.</p>

<p><i>Britain</i>, from her earliest period, had textile fabrics varying in design
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxxvii">[Pg lxxvii]</span>
and material; of the colours in the woollen garments worn by each of the
three several classes into which our Bardic order was apportioned. Of
the checkered pattern in Boadicea’s cloak we have spoken just now,
<a href="#Page_xii">p. xii</a>.</p>

<p>Of the beauty and wide repute of English needlework, we shall have
to speak when, a little further on, we reach the subject of embroidery.</p>

<p>From John Garland’s words, which we gave at <a href="#Page_xxii">p. xxii</a>, it would seem
that all the lighter and more tasteful webs wrought here came from
women’s hands; and the loom, one of which must have been in almost
every English nunnery and homestead, was of the simplest make.</p>

<p>In olden times, the Egyptians wove in an upright loom, and beginning
at top so as to weave downwards, sat at their work. In Palestine the
weaver had an upright loom too, but beginning at bottom and working
upwards, was obliged to stand. During the mediæval period the loom,
here at least, was horizontal, as is shown by the one figured in that
gorgeously illuminated Bedford Book of Hours, fol. 32, at which the
Blessed Virgin Mary is seated weaving curtains for the temple.</p>

<p>As samples of one of the several kinds of work wrought by our nuns
and mynchens, as well as English ladies, we refer to Nos. <a href="#h-1233">1233</a>, p.
24, <a href="#h-1256">1256</a>, p. 33, <a href="#h-1270">1270</a>, p. 38, demonstrating the ability of their handicraft
as well as elegance in design during the thirteenth century. For
specimens of the commoner sorts of silken textiles and of wider breadth,
which began to be woven in this country under Edward III., it would
be as hard as hazardous to direct the reader. Very recent examples of
all sorts&mdash;velvets among the rest&mdash;may be found in the Brooke collection.
To some students the piece of Old English printed chintz, No. <a href="#h-1622">1622</a>, p.
84, will not be without an interest.</p>

<p>For the finer sort of linen napery, Eylisham or Ailesham in Lincolnshire
was famous during the fourteenth century. Exeter cathedral, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>
1327, had “unum manutergium de Eylisham”&mdash;a hand towel of Ailesham
cloth.<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p>Our coarser native textiles in wool, in thread or in both, woven
together, forming a stuff called “burel,” made of which St. Paul’s
London, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1295, had a light blue chasuble;<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> and Exeter cathedral,
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1277, a long pall;<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> all sorts, in fine, of heavier work, were wrought
in our monasteries for men. By their rule the Benedictine monks,
and all their offsets, were bound to give a certain number of hours
every week-day to hand work, either at home or in the field.
<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxxviii">[Pg lxxviii]</span></p>

<p>Weeping over the wars and strife in England during the year 1265
and the woes of the people, our Matthew of Westminster sums up,
among our losses, the fall in our trade of woollen stuffs, with which we
used to supply the world. O Anglia olim gloriosa ... licet maris
angustata littoribus ... tibi tamen per orbem benedixerunt omnium
latera nationum de tuis ovium velleribus calefacta.<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

<p>The weaving in this country of woollen cloth, as a staple branch of
trade, is older than some are willing to believe. Of the monks at Bath
abbey we are told by a late writer, “the shuttle and the loom employed
their attention, (about the middle of the fourteenth century,) and under
their active auspices the weaving of woollen cloth (which made its appearance
in England about the year 1330, and received the sanction of
an Act of Parliament in 1337) was introduced, established, and brought
to such perfection at Bath as rendered this city one of the most considerable
in the west of England for this manufacture.”<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> Worcester
cloth, which was of a fine quality, was so good, that by a chapter of the
Benedictine Order, held <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1422, at Westminster Abbey, it was forbidden
to be worn by the monks, and declared smart enough for military
men.<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> Norwich, too, wove stuffs that were in demand for costly household
furniture, for, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1394, Sir John Cobham bequeathed to his
friends “a bed of Norwich stuff embroidered with butterflies.”<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> In one
of the chapels at Durham Priory there were four blue cushions of
Norwich work.<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> Worsted, a town in Norfolk, by a new method of its
own for the carding of the wool with combs of iron well heated, and
then twisting the thread harder than usual in the spinning, enabled our
weavers to produce a woollen stuff of a fine peculiar quality, to which
the name itself of worsted was immediately given. Unto such a high
repute did the new web grow that liturgical raiment and domestic furniture
of the choicest sorts were made out of it; Exeter cathedral, among
its chasubles, had several “de nigro worsted” in cloth of gold. Elizabeth
de Bohun, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1356, bequeathed to her daughter the Countess of
Arundel “a bed of red worsted embroidered;”<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> and Joane Lady Bergavenny
leaves to John of Ormond “a bed of cloth of gold with lebardes,
with those cushions and tapettes of my best red worsted,”<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> &amp;c. Of the
sixteen standards of worsted entailed with the bear and a chain which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxxix">[Pg lxxix]</span>
floated aloft in the ship of Beauchamp Earl of Warwick, we have spoken
before (p. xliii.) In the “Fabric Rolls of York Minster” vestments
made of worsted&mdash;there variously spelt “worsett,”<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> and “woryst”<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>&mdash;are
enumerated.</p>

<p><i>Irish</i> cloth, white and red, in the reign of John, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1213, was much
used in England; and in the household expenses of Swinford, bishop of
Hereford, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1290, an item occurs of Irish cloth for lining.
<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p>But our weavers knew how to throw off from their looms, artistically
designed and well-figured webs; in the “Wardrobe Accounts” of our
Edward II. we read this item: “to a mercer of London for a green
hanging of wool wove with figures of kings and earls upon it, for the
king’s service in his hall on solemn feasts at London.”<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> Such “salles,”
as they were called in France, and “hullings,” or rather “hallings,” the
name they went under here, were much valued abroad, and in common
use at home: under the head of “Salles d’Angleterre,” among the
articles of costly furniture belonging to Charles V. of France, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1364,
who began his reign some forty years after our Edward II.’s death, one
set of such hangings is thus put down: “une salle d’Angleterre vermeille
brodée d’azur, et est la bordeure à vignettes et le dedens de lyons, d’aigles
et de lyepars,” quoted from the MS. No. <a href="#h-8356">8356</a>, in the Imperial Library,
Paris, by Michel;<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> while here in England, Richard Earl of Arundel,
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1392, willed to his dear wife “the hangings of the hall which was
lately made in London, of blue tapestry with red roses with the arms of
my sons,”<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> &amp;c.; and Lady Bergavenny, after bequeathing her hullying

<p><i>Flemish</i> textiles, at least of the less ambitious kinds, such as napery and
woollens, were much esteemed centuries ago, and our countryman,
Matthew of Westminster, says of Flanders, that from the material&mdash;perhaps
wool&mdash;which we sent her, she sent us back those precious garments
she wove.<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

<p>Though industrious everywhere within her limits, some of her towns
stood foremost for certain kinds of stuff, and Bruges became in the latter
end of the fifteenth century conspicuous for its silken textiles. Here in
England, the satins of Bruges were in great use for church garments; in
Haconbie church, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1566, was “one white vestmente of Bridges
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxxx">[Pg lxxx]</span>
satten repte in peces and a clothe made thereof to hange before our
pulpitt;”<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> and, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1520, York cathedral had “a vestment of balkyn
(baudekin) with a crosse of green satten in bryges.”<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

<p>Her damask silks were equally in demand; and the specimens here
will interest the reader. Nos. <a href="#h-8318">8318</a>, p. 190, <a href="#h-8332">8332</a>, p. 197, show the
ability of the Bruges loom, while the then favourite pattern with the
pomegranate in it, betrays the likings of the Spaniards, at that time the
rulers of the country, for this token of their beloved Isabella’s reconquered
Granada. No. <a href="#h-8319">8319</a>, p. 191, is another sample of Flemish
weaving, rich in its gold, and full of beauty in design.</p>

<p>In her velvets, Flanders had no need to fear a comparison with anything
of the kind that Italy ever threw off from her looms, whether at
Venice, Florence, or Genoa, as the samples we have here under Nos.
<a href="#h-8673">8673</a>, p. 254, <a href="#h-8674">8674</a>, p. 255, <a href="#h-8704">8704</a>, p. 264, will prove. Nay, this last
specimen, with its cloth of gold ground, and its pattern in a dark blue
deep-piled velvet, is not surpassed in gorgeousness even by that splendid
stuff from Florence yet to be seen in one of the copes for Westminster
Abbey given it by Henry VII.</p>

<p>Block-printed linen was, toward the end of the fourteenth century,
another production of Flanders, of which pieces may be seen at Nos.
<a href="#h-7022">7022</a>, p. 118, <a href="#h-7027">7027</a>, p. 120, <a href="#h-8303">8303</a>, p. 184, <a href="#h-8615">8615</a>, p. 234. Though to
the eyes of many, these may look so poor, so mean; to men like the
cotton-printers of Lancashire and other places they will have a strong
attraction; to the scholar they will be deeply interesting as suggestive of
the art of printing. Such specimens are rare, but it is likely that England
can show, in the chapter library at Durham, the earliest sample of the
kind as yet known, in a fine sheet wrapped about the body of some old
bishop discovered, along with several pieces of ancient silks, and still more
ancient English embroidery, in a grave opened by Mr. Raine, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1827,
within that grand northern cathedral.</p>

<p>What Bruges was in silks and velvets Yprès, in the sixteenth century,
became for linen, and for many years Flemish linens had been in favourite
use throughout England. Hardly a church of any size, scarcely a gentleman’s
house in this country, but used a quantity of towels and other
napery that was made in Flanders, especially at Yprès.<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> Of this textile
instances may be seen at pp. <a href="#Page_34">34</a>, <a href="#Page_73">73</a>, <a href="#Page_75">75</a>, <a href="#Page_124">124</a>, <a href="#Page_203">203</a>, <a href="#Page_205">205</a>, <a href="#Page_255">255</a>, <a href="#Page_263">263</a>.</p>

<p><i>French</i> silks, now in such extensive use, were until the end of the
sixteenth century not much cared for in France itself, and seldom heard
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxxxi">[Pg lxxxi]</span>
of abroad. The reader, then, must not be astonished at finding so few
examples of the French loom, in a collection of ancient silken textiles.</p>

<p>France, as England, used of old to behold her women, old and young,
rich and poor, while filling up their leisure hours in-doors, at work on a
small loom, and weaving certain narrow webs, often of gold, and diapered
with coloured silks, as we mentioned before (p. <a href="#Page_xxii">xxii</a>.) Of such French
wrought stuffs belonging to the thirteenth century, some samples are
described at pp. <a href="#Page_29">29</a>, <a href="#Page_130">130</a>, <a href="#Page_131">131</a>.</p>

<p>In damasks, her earliest productions are of the sixteenth century, and
are described at pp. <a href="#Page_13">13</a>, <a href="#Page_205">205</a>, <a href="#Page_206">206</a>; and the last is a favourable example
of what the loom then was in France; everything later is of that type so
well known to everybody. In several of her textiles a leaning towards
classicism in design is discernible.</p>

<p>Though so few, her cloths of gold, pp. <a href="#Page_9">9</a>, <a href="#Page_15">15</a>, are good, more especially
the fine one at p. <a href="#Page_104">104</a>.</p>

<p>Her velvets, too, pp. <a href="#Page_14">14</a>, <a href="#Page_89">89</a>, <a href="#Page_106">106</a>, are satisfactory.</p>

<p>Satins from France are not many here.</p>

<p>The curious and elaborately ornamented gloves, p. <a href="#Page_105">105</a>, which got into
fashion, especially for ladies, at the end of the sixteenth century, will be
a welcome object for such as are curious in the history of women’s dress,
in France and England.</p>

<p>Quilting, too, on coverlets, shown at pp. <a href="#Page_13">13</a>, <a href="#Page_104">104</a>, displays the taste
of our neighbours in such stitchery, so much in use among them and ourselves
from the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>Like Flanders, France knew how to weave fine linen, which here in
England was much in use for ecclesiastical as well as household purposes.
Three new cloths of Rains (Rennes in Brittany) were, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1327, in
use for the high altar in Exeter cathedral,<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> and many altar-cloths of
Paris linen. In the poem of the “Squier of Low Degree,” the lady is

<p>and, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1434, Joane Lady Bergavenny devises in her will, “two pair

<p><i>Cologne</i>, the queen of the Rhine, became famous during the whole of
the fifteenth and part of the sixteenth century for a certain kind of ecclesiastical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxxxii">[Pg lxxxii]</span>
textile which, from the very general use to which it has been
applied, we have named “orphrey web.” Since by far the greater part
of this collection, as it now exists, had been made in Germany, beginning
with Cologne, it is, as might be expected, well supplied with specimens
of a sort of stuff, if not peculiar, at least abounding in that country.
Those same liturgical ornaments which Venice and Florence wove with
such artistic taste for Italian church use, Cologne succeeded in doing for
Germany. Her productions, however, are every way far below in beauty
Italy’s like works. The Italian orphrey-webs are generally done in gold
or yellow silk, upon a crimson ground of silk. Florence’s are often distinguished
from those of Venice by the introduction of white for the
faces; Cologne’s vary from both by introducing blue, while the material
is almost always very poor, and the weaving coarse.</p>

<p>The earliest specimen here of this Cologne orphrey-web is No. <a href="#h-8279">8279</a>,

to be found at pp. <a href="#Page_61">61</a>, <a href="#Page_62">62</a>, <a href="#Page_63">63</a>, <a href="#Page_64">64</a>, <a href="#Page_69">69</a>, <a href="#Page_80">80</a>, <a href="#Page_82">82</a>, <a href="#Page_116">116</a>, <a href="#Page_117">117</a>, <a href="#Page_118">118</a>, <a href="#Page_119">119</a>, <a href="#Page_174">174</a>, <a href="#Page_175">175</a>,

p. 61, a good specimen, has the persons of the saints so woven that the
heads, hands, and emblems are wrought with the needle; the same, too,
in Nos. <a href="#h-7023">7023</a>, p. 118, and <a href="#h-8667">8667</a>, p. 252; in No. <a href="#h-1373">1373</a>, though the golden
ground looks very fresh and brilliant, the gilding process, as on wood, has
been employed. Here in England this orphrey web was in church use
and called “rebayn de Colayn.”<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>
<p>The piece of German napery at No. <a href="#h-8317">8317</a>, p. 190, of the beginning

acceptable specimen.</p>

<p>If by hazard while reading some old inventory of church vestments
the reader should stumble upon some entry mentioning a chasuble made
of cloth of Cologne, let him understand it to mean not a certain broad
textile woven there, but merely a vestment composed of several pieces of
this kind of web sewed together, just as was the frontal made out of
pieces of woven Venice orphreys at No. <a href="#h-8976">8976</a>, p. 271.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The countries whence silks came to us</span> are numerous; with
confidence, however, we may say, that till the middle of the fifteenth
century, when we began to weave some of them for ourselves, the whole
geography of silken textiles lay within the basin of the Mediterranean to
the west, and the continent of Asia to the east.</p>

<p>Though mention is often made of tissues coming from various places,
those cities are always to be found upon the map we have just marked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxxxiii">[Pg lxxxiii]</span>
out. Among those spoken of <i>Antioch</i>, <i>Tarsus</i>, <i>Alexandria</i>, <i>Damascus</i>,
<i>Byzantium</i>, <i>Cyprus</i>, <i>Trip</i> or <i>Tripoli</i>, and <i>Bagdad</i>, are easily recognized, as
well as the later centres of trade and manufacture, Venice, Genoa and
Lucca. To fix the localities of a few others would be but guess-work.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the fourteenth century is mentioned occasionally
a silk called “<i>Acca</i>,” and, from the description of it, it must have been a
cloth of gold shot with coloured silk, figured with animals: William de
Clinton, Earl of Huntingdon, gave to St. Alban’s monastery a whole
vestment of cloth of gold shot with sky-blue, and called cloth of Acca;
“unum vestimentum ... de panno quem Accam dicimus; cujus
campus est aerius. In reliquis vero partibus resultat auri fulgor.”<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> To
some it would look as if this stuff took its name from having been brought
to us through the port of Acre. We lean towards this belief on finding,
on the authority of Macri, in his valuable Hierolexicon, Venice, 1735,
pp. 5, 542, that so used to be written the name of the ancient Ptolemais
in Syria.</p>

<p>What in one age, and at a particular place, happened to be so well
made, and hence became so eagerly sought for, at a later period, and in
another place, got to be much better wrought and at a lower price.
Time, indeed, changed the name of the market, but did not alter in any
great degree either the quality of the material, or the style of the design
wrought upon it. All over the kingdom of the Byzantine Greeks the
loom had to change its gearing very little. The Saracenic loom, whether
in Asia, Africa, or Spain, was always Arabic, though Persia could not forget
her olden Zoroasterian traditions about the “hom” or tree of life
separating lions, and having all about lion-hunting cheetahs, and birds of
various sorts.</p>

<p>With regard to the whole of Asia, we learn that its many peoples,
from the earliest times, knew how not only to weave cloth of gold, but
figure it too with birds and beasts. Almost two thousand years afterwards,
Marco Polo, in the thirteenth century, found exactly the very
same kinds of textile known in the days of Darius still everywhere, from
the shores of the Mediterranean to far Cathay, in demand and woven.
What he says of Bagdad, he repeats in fewer words about many other
cities.<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<p>In finding their way to England these fabrics had given them not so
often the names of the places where they had been wrought, but, if not
in all, at least in most instances, the names of the seaports in the
Mediterranean where they had been shipped.</p>

<p>For beautifully wrought and figured silk, of the few terms that still
outlive the mediæval period, one is <i>Damask</i>.</p>

<p>China, no doubt, was the first country to ornament its silken webs
with a pattern. India, Persia and Syria, then Byzantine Greece, followed,
but at long intervals between, in China’s footsteps. Stuffs so figured
brought with them to the west the name “diaspron” or diaper, bestowed
upon them at Constantinople. But about the twelfth century, so very
far did the city of Damascus, even then long celebrated for its looms,
outstrip all other places for beauty of design, that her silken textiles were
eagerly sought for everywhere, and thus, as often happens, traders
fastened the name of Damascen or Damask upon every silken fabric
richly wrought and curiously designed, no matter whether it came or not
from Damascus. After having been for ages the epithet betokening
all that was rich and good in silk, “Samit” had to be forgotten, and
Diaper, from being the very word significant of pattern, became a
secondary term descriptive of merely a part in the elaborate design on
Damask.</p>

<p><i>Baudekin</i>, that sort of costly cloth of gold spoken of so much during
so many years in English literature, took, as we said before, its famous
name from Bagdad.</p>

<p>Many are the specimens in this collection furnishing proofs of the
ancient weavers’ dexterity in their management of the loom, but especially
of the artists’ taste in setting out so many of their intricate and beautiful
designs.</p>

<p>What to some will be happily curious is that we have this very day
before our eyes pieces, in all likelihood, from the self-same web which
furnished the material, centuries ago, for vestments and ornaments used
of old in the cathedrals of England. Let any one turn to p. <a href="#Page_122">122</a>, and,
after looking at number <a href="#h-7036">7036</a>, compare that silk with this item in the
inventory of St. Paul’s, London, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1225: “Item, Baudekynus
rubeus cum Sampsone constringente ora leonum,” &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> See also number

<p>An identification between very many samples, brought together here,
of ancient textiles in silk, and the descriptions of such stuffs afforded us
in those valuable records&mdash;our old church inventories&mdash;might be carried
on, if necessary, to a very lengthened extent.</p>

<p><i>Dorneck</i> was the name given to an inferior kind of damask wrought
of silk, wool, linen thread and gold, in Flanders. Towards the end of
the fifteenth century, mostly at Tournay, which city, in Flemish, was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxxxv">[Pg lxxxv]</span>
often called Dorneck&mdash;a word variously spelt as Darnec, Darnak,
Darnick, and sometimes even Darness.</p>

<p>The gild of the Blessed Virgin Mary at Boston had a care cloth of
silke dornex and church furniture.<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> The “care cloth” was a sort of canopy
held over the bride and bridegroom as they knelt for the nuptial blessing,
according to the Salisbury rite, at the marriage mass. At Exeter
it was used in chasubles for orphreys.<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> A specimen of Dornex may

<p><i>Buckram</i>, a cotton textile, has a history and a reputation somewhat
varied.</p>

<p>In our oldest inventories mention is often made of a “panus Tartaricus”
or Tartary cloth, which was, if not always, at least often purple. Asia,
especially in its eastern borders, became famous for the fine textiles it
wove out of cotton, and dyed in every colour. Cities got for themselves
a reputation for some especial excellence in their looms, and as
Mosul had the name of Muslin from that place given to the fine and
delicate cotton webs it wrought, so the term of buckram for another
sort of cotton textile came from the city of Bokhara in Tartary where
this cloth was made. All along the middle ages buckram was much
esteemed for being costly and very fine, and consequently fit for use in
church vestments, and for secular personal wear. John Grandison, consecrated
bishop of Exeter, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1327, gave to his cathedral flags of white
and red buckram;<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> and among the five very rich veils for covering the
moveable lectern in that church, three were lined with blue “bokeram.”<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>
As late as the beginning of the sixteenth century this stuff was held
good enough for lining to a black velvet gown for a queen, Elizabeth of
York.<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> The coarse thick fabric which now goes by the name was
anything but the olden production known as “bokeram.”</p>

<p><i>Burdalisaunder</i>, <i>Bordalisaunder</i>, <i>Bourde de Elisandre</i>, with other
varieties in spelling, is a term often to be met with in old wills and
church inventories. In the year 1327 Exeter had a chasuble of Bourde
de Elisandre of divers colours.<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> It was wide enough for half a piece to
form the adornment of a high altar.<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

<p>The difficulty of understanding what this textile was will vanish when
we remember that in Arabic “bord” to this day means a striped cloth;
and we know, both from travellers and the importation of the textile
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxxxvi">[Pg lxxxvi]</span>
itself, that many tribes in North and Eastern Africa weave stuffs for
personal wear of a pattern consisting of white and black longitudinal
stripes. St. Augustin too, living in North Africa near the modern
Algiers, speaks of a stuff for clothing called “burda,” in the end of the
fourth and beginning of the fifth century. Burdalisaunder was a silken
web in different coloured stripes, and specimens of this, at one time known
as “stragulata” may be found here at pp. <a href="#Page_21">21</a>, <a href="#Page_27">27</a>, <a href="#Page_33">33</a>, <a href="#Page_56">56</a>, <a href="#Page_57">57</a>, <a href="#Page_161">161</a>, <a href="#Page_225">225</a>,
<a href="#Page_226">226</a>, &amp;c. Though made in so many places round the Mediterranean,
this silk took its name, at least in England, from Alexandria, because it
was to be had in that Egyptian city, always celebrated for its silks,
either better made or at a much lower price than elsewhere.</p>

<p>In all likelihood the curtains for the tabernacle, as well as the girdles
for Aaron and his sons, of fine linen and violet and purple, and scarlet
twice dyed, were wrought with this very pattern, so that in the
“stragulata” or “burd Aliscaunder” we behold the oldest known design
for any textile.</p>

<p><i>Fustian</i>, of which two of its forms we still have in velveteen and
corduroy, was originally wove at Fustat, on the Nile, with a warp of
linen thread and a woof of thick cotton, which was so twilled and cut
that it showed on one side a thick but low pile; and the web so managed
took its name of Fustian from that Egyptian city. At what period it
was invented we do not rightly know, but we are well aware it must
have been brought to this country before the Normans coming hither,
for our Anglo-Saxon countryman, St. Stephen Harding, when a Cistercian
abbot and an old man, <i>circ.</i> <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1114, forbade chasubles in his church
to be made of anything but fustian or plain linen: “neque casulas nisi
de fustaneo vel lino sine pallio aureo vel argenteo,” &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> The austerity of
his rule reached even the ornament of the church. From such a prohibition
we are not to draw as a conclusion that fustian was at the time a
mean material; quite the contrary, it was a seemly textile. Years afterwards,
in the fourteenth century, Chaucer tells us of his knight:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Of fustian he wered a gepon.<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Fustian, so near akin to velvet, is more especially noticed along with
what is said upon that fine textile.</p>

<p>In the fifteenth century Naples had a repute for weaving fustians, but
our English churchwardens, not being learned in geography, made some
laughable bad spelling of this, like some other continental stuffs: “Fuschan
in appules,” for fustian from Naples, is droll; yet droller still is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxxxvii">[Pg lxxxvii]</span>
“mustyrd devells,” for a cloth made in France at a town called Mustrevilliers.</p>

<p><i>Muslin</i>, as it is now throughout the world, so from the earliest antiquity
has been everywhere in Asia in favourite use, both as an article of
dress and as furniture. Its cloud-like thinness, its lightness, were, as
they still are to some Asiatics, not the only charms belonging to this
stuff: it was esteemed equally as much for the taste in which stripes of
gold had been woven in its warp. As we learn from the travels of
Marco Polo, the further all wayfarers in Asia wandered among its
eastern nations, the higher they found the point of excellence which had
been reached by those people in weaving silk and gold into splendid
fabrics. If the silkworm lived, nay, thrived there, the cotton plant was
in its home, its birth-place, in those regions. Where stood Nineveh
Mosul stands now.</p>

<p>Like many cities of Middle Asia, Mosul had earned for itself a reputation
of old for the beauty of its gold-wrought silken textiles. Cotton
grew all around in plenty; the inhabitants, especially the women, being
gifted with such quick feeling of finger, could spin thread from this
cotton of more than hair-like fineness. Cotton then took with them, on
many occasions, the place of silk in the loom; but gold was not forgotten
in the texture. This new fabric, not only because it was so much
cheaper, but from its own peculiar beauty and comeliness, won for itself
a high place in common estimation. At once, and by the world’s
accord, on it was bestowed as its distinctive name, the name of the
place where it was wrought in such perfection. Hence, whether wove
with or without gold, we call to this day this cotton web Muslin, from
the Asiatic city of Mosul.</p>

<p><i>Cloth of Areste</i> is another of those terms for woven stuffs which
students of textiles had never heard of were it not to be found in our
old English deeds and inventories. The first time we meet it is in an
order given, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1244, by Henry III. for finding two of these cloths of
Areste with which two copes had to be made for royal chapels: “Duos
pannos del Areste ad duas capas faciendas,” &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> Again it comes a few
years later at St. Paul’s, which cathedral, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1295, had, besides a
dalmatic and tunicle of this silk&mdash;“de serico albo diasperato de Arest,”<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>&mdash;as
many as thirty and more hangings of this same texture.<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>

<p>From the description of these pieces we gather that this so-called cloth
of Areste must have been as beautiful as it was rich, being for the most
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxxxviii">[Pg lxxxviii]</span>
part cloth of gold figured elaborately, some with lions and double-headed
eagles, others, for example, with the death and burial of our Lord&mdash;“campus
aureus cum leonibus et aquilis bicapitibus de aurifilo contextis&mdash;campus
rubeus cum historia Passionis Domini et sepulturæ
ejusdem.” These designs speak of the looms at work in the middle
ages on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean, and we are much
strengthened in this thought by beholding how the death and burial of
our Lord, like the sample here, number <a href="#h-8278">8278</a>, p. 170-1, are shown on
a crimson ground, as we shall have to instance further on under
Symbolism, § VII.</p>

<p>That this sort of stuff, wove of silk and gold, was of any kind of
Arras, or made in that town, to our seeming is a very unhappy guess.
Arras had not won for itself a reputation for its tapestry before the
fourteenth century. Tapestry itself is too thick and heavy for use in
vestments; yet this cloth of Areste was light enough for tunicles, and
when worn out was sometimes condemned at St. Paul’s to be put
aside for lining other ritual garments&mdash;“ad armaturam faciendam.”<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>
The term “Areste” has little or nothing in it common to the word
“Arras,” as written either in French, or under its Latin appellation
“Atrebatum.”</p>

<p>Among the three meanings for the mediæval “Aresta,” one is, any
kind of covering. To us, then, it seems as if these cloths of Areste
took their name not from the place whereat they had been wove, but
from the use to which, if not always, for the most part, we put them&mdash;that
of hangings about our churches, since in the St. Paul’s inventory
they are usually spoken of as such&mdash;“culcitræ pendules, panni penduli.”<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>
Moreover, tapestry, or Arras work, being thick and heavy, could never
have been employed for such light use as that of apparels, nor would it
have been diapered like silk, yet we find it to have been so fashioned
and so used&mdash;“maniculariis apparatis quodam panno rubeo diasperato de
Laret, &amp;c.”<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p>

<p>For not a few it would be hard to understand some at least among
those epithets meant in by-gone days to tell how</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Silks were distinguished through their colours
and shades of colour.</span></h3>

<p>To the inventories of vestments and church-stuffs of all sorts must we
go to gather the information which we want about the textiles in use in
this country at any particular period during by-gone days. The men
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxxxix">[Pg lxxxix]</span>
who had, in the thirteenth century, the drawing up of such lists, seem
to have been gifted with a keen eye for the varieties of shade and tints
in the colour of silks then before them. For instance, a chasuble at
St. Paul’s, London, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1295, is set down thus:&mdash;“De sameto purpureo
aliquantulum sanguineo”&mdash;that is, made of samit (a thick silk)
dyed in a purple somewhat bordering on a blood-red tone. Such language
is unmistakable; not so, however, many other terms at the time in
common use, and though well understood then, are now not so intelligible.
We are told in the same inventory<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> several times of a “pannus
Tarsicus,” a Tarsus cloth, and of a “pannus Tarsici coloris,” a Tarsus
coloured cloth. What may have been the distinctive qualities of the
stuffs woven at Tarsus, what the peculiar beauty in that tint to which
that once so celebrated city had given its own name, we cannot say.
We think, however, those Tarsus textiles were partly of silk, partly of
fine goats’ hair, and for this reason Varro tells<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a>&mdash;“Tondentur (capræ)
quod magnis villis sunt, in magna parte Phrygiæ; unde Cilicia, et cætera
ejus generis ferri solent. Sed, quod primum ea tonsura in Cilicia sit
instituta, nomen id Cilicas adjecisse dicunt.” Goats are shorn in a great
part of Phrygia, because there they have long shaggy hair. Cilicia (the
Latin for hair cloths) and other things of the same sort, are usually
brought from that country. For the reason that in Cilicia such a shearing
of goats arose, they say that the name of Cilician was given to such
stuffs woven of goats’ hair. As Tarsus is, so always was it, the head
city in all that part of Asia Minor known of old as Phrygia. Hence
then we think that&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Cloth of Tarsus</i>, <i>of Tars</i>, &amp;c., was woven of fine goats’ hair and
silk. But this web was in several colours, and always looked upon as
very costly.</p>

<p>The <i>Tarsus colour</i> itself was, as we take it, some shade of purple differing
from, and perhaps to some eyes more beautiful than, the Tyrian
dye. The people of Tarsus no doubt got from their murex, a shell-fish
of the class mollusca and purpurifera family to be found on their coast,
their dyeing matter; and when it is borne in mind what changes are
wrought in the animal itself by the food it eats, and what strong effects
are made by slight variations in climate, even atmosphere, upon materials
for colouring in the moments of application, we may easily understand
how the difference arose between the two tints of purple.</p>

<p>We are strengthened in our conjecture that not only was the cloth
of Tarsus of a rare and costly kind, but its tint some shade of royal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xc">[Pg xc]</span>
purple, from the fact that while noticing the robes worn on a grand
public occasion by a king, Chaucer thus sketches the prince:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sky-blue</i> was a liturgical colour everywhere in use for certain festivals
throughout England, as we have shown in another place.<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> In the
early inventories the name for that tint is “Indicus,” “Indus,”
reminding us of our present <i>indigo</i>. In later lists it is called “Blodius,”
not sanguinary, but blue.</p>

<p><i>Murrey</i>, or a reddish brown, is often specified; and a good specimen
of the tint is given us, No. <a href="#h-709">709</a>, p. 9. Old St. Paul’s, London, had
several pieces of baudekin of this colour: “baudekynus murretus cum
griffonibus datus pro anima. Alphonsi filii regis E.”<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<p>Going far down, and much below the middle ages, Purple, in all its
tones, and tints, and shades, was spoken of and looked upon as allowable
to be worn in garments only to worshipful, ennobled, or royal
personages. Whether it glowed with the brightness it seemed to have
stolen from the rose, or wore its darkest tone it could borrow from the
violet, whether it put on any one of those hundred shades to be found
between those two extremes, it mattered not; it was gazed at with an
admiring, a respectful eye. Eagerly sought out, and bought at high
price, were those textiles that showed this colour, and had been dyed
at Tyre, Antioch, Tarsus, Alexandria, Byzantium, or Naples. All
these places were at one time or another, in days of old, famous for their
looms, no less than their ability in the dyeing, especially of purple, among
the nations living on the shores of the Mediterranean; and each of them
had in its own tone a shade which distinguished it from that of all
the others. What the tint of purple was which established this difference
we cannot at this distance of time, and with our means of knowing,
justly say. Of this, however, we are perfectly aware, that silks of
purple usually bore their specific name from those above-named cities,
as we perceive while reading the old inventories of our churches and
cathedrals. Moreover, our native writers let us know that, if not always
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xci">[Pg xci]</span>
from Greece, it was through that country that purple textiles were
brought to England. Besides speaking of a conversation held about,
beside other things, the produce of Greece in purple silks&mdash;“Græcorum
purpuris, et pannis holosericis”&mdash;Gerald Barry gives us to understand that
in his days not only were our churches sumptuously hung with costly
palls and purple silks, but that these textiles were the work of Grecian
looms&mdash;“rex (Willielmus Rufus) ecclesiam quandam (in nova foresta)
intraret quam adeo pulchram et decentius ornatam auletis historicis, et
pretiosis Græcorum palliis, pannis holosericis et purpureis undique vestitam,”
&amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></p>

<p>Silks woven of two colours, so that one of them showed itself unmixed
and quite distinct on one side, and the second appeared equally clean on
the other&mdash;a thing sometimes now looked upon as a wonder in modern
weaving&mdash;might occasionally be met with here at the mediæval period:
Exeter Cathedral had, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1327:&mdash;“Unus pannus sericus curtus rubei

<p><i>Marble</i> silk had a weft of several colours so put together and woven
as to make the whole web look like marble, stained with a variety of
tints; hence it got its name. In the year 1295 St. Paul’s had “paruram
de serico marmoreo”<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>&mdash;an apparel of marble silk; “tunica de quodam

“casula marmorei coloris”<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a>&mdash;a chasuble of marble colour. During
full three centuries this marble silk found great favour among us since
H. Machyn, in his very valuable and curious Diary tells his readers how

The</span> art of working with the needle flowers, fruits, human
and animal forms, or any fanciful design, upon webs woven
of silk, linen, cotton, wool, hemp, besides other kinds of
stuff, is so old that it reaches far into the prehistoric ages.</p>

<p>Those patterns, after so many fashions, which we see figured upon the
garments worn by men and women in Egyptian and Assyrian monuments,
but especially on the burned-clay vases made and painted by the
Greeks during their most archaic as well as later times, or we read about
in the writings of that people, were not wrought in the loom, but done
by the needle.</p>

<p>The old Egyptian loom&mdash;and that of the Jews must have been like
it&mdash;was, as we know from paintings, of the simplest shape, and seems to
have never been able to do anything more diversified in the designs of
its patterns than straight lines in different colours, and at best nothing
higher in execution than checker-work: beyond this, all else was put in by
hand with the needle. In Paris, at the Louvre, are several pieces of early
Egyptian webs coloured, drawings of which have been published by Sir
Gardner Wilkinson in his short work “The Egyptians in the time of
the Pharaohs.”<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> There are two pieces of the same textile scarlet, with
one brede woven of narrow red stripes on a broad yellow stripe, the
other border being a broad yellow stripe edged by a narrow scarlet one,
both wrought up and down with needlework; the second piece of blue
is figured all over in white embroidery with a pattern of netting, the
meshes of which shut in irregular cubic shapes, and in the lines of the
reticulation the mystic “gammadion” or “fylfot” is seen. Of them Sir
J. G. Wilkinson says:&mdash;“They are mostly cotton, and, though their date
is uncertain, they suffice to show that the manufacture was Egyptian; and
the many dresses painted on the monuments of the eighteenth dynasty
show that the most varied patterns were used by the Egyptians more
than 3000 years ago, as they were at a later period by the Babylonians,
who became noted for their needlework.”<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> Other specimens of Egyptian
embroidery were on those corslets sent to Grecian temples by Amasis,
about which we have before spoken (p. <a href="#Page_xiv">xiv</a>.)</p>

<p>That the Israelites embroidered their garments, especially those worn
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xciii">[Pg xciii]</span>
in public worship, is clear from several passages in the Book of Exodus.
The words “embroidery” and “embroidered” that come there so
frequently in our English versions are not to be understood always to
mean needlework, but on occasions the tasteful weaving in stripes of the
gold, violet, and purple, and scarlet twice dyed, and fine twisted linen;
the pomegranates at the bottom of Aaron’s tunic between the golden
bells, and wrought of four of these stuffs, were, it is likely, made out
of such coloured shreds, and of that kind which is now called cut-work.</p>

<p>Picking up from Greek and Latin writers only, as was his wont, those
scraps of which his Natural History is made, Pliny tells us, even in
Homer, mention is made of embroidered cloths, which originated such
as by the Romans are called “triumphal.” To do this with the
needle was found out by the Phrygians, hence such garments took the
name Phrygionic: “Pictas vestes jam apud Homerum fuisse unde triumphales
natæ. Acu facere id, Phryges invenerunt ideoque Phrygioniæ
appellatæ sunt.”<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> He might have added that the only word the Romans
had to mean an embroiderer was “Phrygio,” which arose from the same
cause. Many passages in Virgil show that from Western Asia the
Romans learned their knowledge of embroidery, and borrowed the
employment of it on their garments of State; besides, “those art-wrought
vests of splendid purple tint:”&mdash;“arte laboratæ vestes ostroque superbo,”<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>
brought forth for the feast by the Sidonian Dido, the Phrygian Andromache
bestows upon Ascanius, as a token of her own handicraft, garments shot
with gold and pictured, as well as a Phrygian cloak, along with other
woven stuffs&mdash;</p>

<p>In Latin while an embroiderer was called a Phrygian, “Phrygio,”
needlework was denominated “Phrygium,” or Phrygian stuff; hence,
when, as often happened, the design was wrought in solid gold wire or
golden thread, the embroidery so worked got named “auriphrygium.”
From this term comes our own old English word “orphrey.” Though
deformed after so many guises by the witless writers of many an inventory
of church goods, or by the sorry cleric who in a moment of needful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xciv">[Pg xciv]</span>
haste had been called upon to draw up a will; other men, however small
their learning, always spelled the word “orphrey,” in English, and “auriphrygium,”
in Latin. In the Exeter inventory, given by Oliver, “cum
orphrey de panno aureo, &amp;c. cum orphrais, &amp;c.”<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> are found; and the
cope bequeathed by Henry Lord de Scrope, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1415, had its “orphreis”
“embraudata nobiliter cum imaginibus,” &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> The many beautiful
orphreys on the Lincoln vestments are fully described in the “Monasticon
Anglicanum:”<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> no one could be more earnest in commanding
the use on vestments of the auriphrygium, or embroidered “orphrey”
than St. Charles Borromeo.<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<p>While Phrygia in general, Babylon in particular became celebrated
for the beauty of its embroideries: “colores diversos picturæ intexere
Babylon maxime celebravit et nomen imposuit;”<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> and those who have
seen the sculptures in the British Museum brought from Nineveh, and
described and figured by Layard, must have witnessed how lavishly the
Assyrians must have adorned their dress with that sort of needlework for
which one of their greatest cities was so famous.</p>

<p>Up to the first century of our era, the reputation which Babylon had
won for her textiles and needlework still lived. Josephus, himself a Jew,
who had often been to worship at Jerusalem, tells us that the veils of its
Temple given by Herod were Babylonian, and of the outer one that
writer says:&mdash;“there was a veil of equal largeness with the door. It
was a Babylonian curtain, embroidered with blue and fine linen, and
scarlet and purple, and of a texture that was wonderful.”<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

</div>

<p>What the Jews did for the Temple we may be sure was done by
Christians for the Church. The faithful, however, went even further,
and wore garments figured all over with passages from Holy Writ
wrought in embroidery. From a stirring sermon preached by St. Asterius,
bishop of Amasia in Pontus, in the fourth century, we learn this.
Taking for his text, “a certain rich man who was clothed in purple and
fine linen,” this father of the Church, while upbraiding the world for its
follies in dress, lets us know that some people went about arrayed like
painted walls, with beasts and flowers all over them; while others, pretending
a more serious tone of thought, dressed in clothes figured with a
sketch of all the doings and wonders of our Lord. “Strive,” thunders
forth St. Asterius, “to follow in your lives the teachings of the Gospel,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xcv">[Pg xcv]</span>
rather than have the miracles of our Redeemer embroidered upon your
outward dress.”<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></p>

<p>To have had so many subjects shown upon one garment, it is clear
that each must have been done very small, and all wrought in outline; a
style which is being brought back, with great effect, into ecclesiastical use.</p>

<p>Of the embroidery done by Christian ladies abroad during the Lower
Roman Empire, we have already spoken, p. <a href="#Page_xxxv">xxxv</a>. Coming to our own
land, and its mediæval times, we find how at the beginning of that period
our Anglo-Saxon sisters knew so well to handle their needle. The many
proofs of this we have brought forward in another place.<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<p>The discriminating accuracy with which our old writers sought to
follow while noting down the several kinds of textile gifts bestowed upon
a church is as instructive as praiseworthy. Ingulph did not think it
enough to say that abbot Egelric had given many hangings to the Church
of Croyland, the great number of which were silken, but he must tell us,
too, that some were ornamented with birds wrought in gold, and sewed
on&mdash;in fact, of cut-work&mdash;other some with those birds woven into the
stuff, other some quite plain:&mdash;“Dedit etiam multa pallia suspendenda
in parietibus ad altaria sanctorum in festis, quorum plurima de serico
erant, aureis volucribus quædam insita, quædam intexta, quædam plana.”<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></p>

<p>So also the care often taken by the writers of inventories, like him who
wrote out the Exeter one, to mention how some of the vestments had
nothing about them but true needlework, or, as they at times express it,
“operata per totum opere acuali,” may be witnessed in that useful work,
“The Lives of the Bishops of Exeter,” by Oliver.<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></p>

<p>By the latter end of the thirteenth century embroidery, as well as its
imitation, got for its several styles and various sorts of ornamentation
mixed up with it a distinguishing and technical nomenclature; and the
earliest document in which we meet with this set of terms is the inventory
drawn up, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1295, of the vestments belonging to our London
St. Paul’s Cathedral: herein, the “opus plumarium,”<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> the “opus pectineum,”
  <a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>

“de serico consuto,”<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> may be severally found in Dugdale’s “History of

<p>The “opus plumarium” was the then usual general term for what is
now commonly called embroidery; and hence, in some old inventories,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xcvi">[Pg xcvi]</span>
we meet with such notices as this:&mdash;“capæ opere plumario factæ id
est, brudatæ.”</p>

<p>This term was given to embroidery needlework because the stitches
were laid down never across but longwise, and so put together that they
seemed to overlap one another like the feathers in the plumage of a bird.
Not inaptly then was this style called “feather-stitch” work, in contradistinction
to that done in cross and tent stitch, or the “cushion-style,”
as we shall, a little further on, have occasion to notice next.</p>

<p>Among the many specimens here done in feather-stitch, in all ages, we
would especially instance No. <a href="#h-84">84</a>, p. 3.</p>

<p>The “opus pulvinarium,” or “cushion style,” was that sort of embroidery
like the present so-called Berlin-work. As now, so then it was
done in the same stitchery, with pretty much the same materials, and put
if not always, at least often, to the same purpose of being used for
cushions, upon which to sit or to kneel in church, or uphold the mass-book
at the altar; hence its name of “cushion-style.” In working it,
silken thread is known to have been often used. Among other specimens,
and in silk, the rare and beautiful liturgical cushion of a date corresponding
to the London inventory, is to be seen here, No. <a href="#h-1324">1324</a>, p. 59. Being
so well adapted for working heraldry, from an early period till now, this
stitch has been mostly used for the purpose; and the emblazoned orphreys,
like the narrow hem on the Syon cope, are wrought in it.</p>

<p>The oldest, the most elaborate, the best known sample in the world,
and what to us is more interesting still from being in reality not French
but English needlework, is the so-called, but misnamed, Bayeux tapestry,
a shred of which is in this collection, No. <a href="#h-675">675</a>, p. 6. Of all this more
anon, § IV.</p>

<p>The “opus pectineum” was a kind of woven-work imitative of embroidery,
and used as such, in truth, about which we have a description
in the Dictionary of the Londoner, John Garland, who thus speaks of
the process: “Textrices ducunt pectines cum trama quæ trahitur a spola
et pano,” &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> From this use of a comb-like instrument&mdash;“pecten”&mdash;in
the manufacture the work itself received the distinctive appellation of
“pectineum,” or comb-wrought. Before John Garland forsook England
for France, to teach a school there, he must have often seen, while at
home, his countrywomen sitting down to such an occupation; and the
“amictus de dono dominæ Kathærinæ de Lovell de opere pectineo,”<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a>
may perhaps have been the doing of that same lady’s own hands.</p>

<p>Likely is it that Helisend, the bold young lady from the south of
England, and one of the waiting maids to the English Maud, queen of
David, king of Scotland, <i>circa</i> <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1150, got, from her cunning in such
work, the reputation of being so skilful in weaving and church-embroidery:&mdash;“operis
texturæ scientia purpuraria nobilis extiterat, et aurifrixoria
artificiosæ compositionis peroptima super omnes Angliæ mulieres
tunc temporis principaliter enituerat.”<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p>

<p>Our mediæval countrywomen were so quick at the needle that they
could make their embroidery look as if it had been done in the loom&mdash;really
woven. Not long ago, a shred of crimson cendal, figured in gold and
silver thread with a knight on horseback, armed as of the latter time of
Edward I., was shown us. At the moment we took the mounted warrior
to have been, not hand-worked, but woven, so flat, so even was
every thread. Looking at it however through a glass and turning it
about, we found it to have been unmistakably embroidered by the
finger in such a way that the stitches for laying down upon the surface,
and not drawing through the gold threads and thus saving expense,
were carried right into the canvas lining at the back of this thin silk.
After this same manner was really done, to our thinking, all the design,
both before and behind upon that fine English-wrought chasuble, No.
<a href="#h-673">673</a>, p. 5.</p>

<p>At the latter end of the thirteenth century our women struck out for
themselves a new way of embroidery. Without leaving aside the old
and usual “opus plumarium,” or feather-stitch, they mixed it with
a new style, both of needlework and mechanism. So beautiful and
telling was the novel method deemed abroad, that it won for itself from
admiring Christendom the complimentary appellation of “opus Anglicum,”
or English work. In what its peculiarity consisted has long been
a question and a puzzle among foreign archæological writers; and a living
one of eminence, the Canon Voisin, vicar general to the bishop of
Tournai, while noticing a cope of English work given to that church,
says:&mdash;“Il serait curieux de savoir quelle broderie ou quel tissu on designait
sous le nom de <i>opus Anglicum</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></p>

<p>But the reader may ask what is</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Opus Anglicum, or English Work</span>,</h3>

<p>about which one heard so much of old?</p>

<p>Happily, we have before us in the present collection, as well as elsewhere
in this country, the means of helping our continental friends with
an answer to their question.</p>

<p>Looking well into that very fine and invaluable piece of English needlework,
the Syon cope, No. <a href="#h-9182">9182</a>, p. 275, we find that for the human
face, all over it, the first stitches were begun in the centre of the cheek,
and worked in circular, not straight lines, into which, however, after the
further side had been made, they fell, and were so carried on through the
rest of the fleshes; in some instances, too, even all through the
figure, draperies and all. But this was done in a sort of chain stitch, and
a newly practised mechanical appliance was brought into use. After the
whole figure had thus been wrought with this kind of chain stitch in
circles and straight lines, then with a little thin iron rod ending in a small
bulb or smooth knob slightly heated, were pressed down those middle spots
in the faces that had been worked in circular lines; as well, too, as that
deep wide dimple in the throat, especially of an aged person. By the
hollows thus lastingly sunk, a play of light and shadow is brought out,
that, at a short distance, lends to the portion so treated a look of being done
in low relief. Chain stitch, then, worked in circular lines, and relief given
to parts by hollows sunk into the faces, and other portions of the persons,
constitute the elements of the “opus Anglicum,” or embroidery after the
English manner. How the chain-stitch was worked into circles for the
faces, and straight lines for the rest of the figures, is well shown by a wood-cut,
after a portion of the Steeple Aston embroideries, given in the
Archæological Journal, t. iv. p. 285.</p>

<p>Though, indeed, not merely the faces and the extremities, but the
dress too of the persons figured, were sometimes wrought in chain-stitch,
and afterwards treated as we have just described, the more general practice
was to work the draperies in our so-called feather-stitch, which used
to be also employed for the grounding, but diapered after a pretty, though
simple, zig-zag design, as we find in the Syon cope.</p>

<p>Apart from its stitching in circles, and those hollows, there are
elements in the design for sacred art-work almost peculiar to mediæval
England. Upon the rood loft in old Westminster Abbey, stood hard by
the cross two six-winged seraphim, each with his feet upon a wheel; so,
too, in the Syon cope, as well as in English needlework on chasubles
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xcix">[Pg xcix]</span>
and copes, wrought even late in the fifteenth century. When, therefore,
such angel-figures are found on embroideries, still to be seen in foreign
hands, a presumption exists that the work is of English production.</p>

<p>How highly English embroideries were at one period appreciated by
foreigners may be gathered from the especial notice taken of them abroad;
and spoken of in continental documents. Matilda, the first Norman
William’s queen, stooped to the meanness of filching from the affrighted
Anglo-Saxon monks of Abingdon their richest church vestments, and
would not be put off with inferior ones.<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> Other instances we have given.
  <a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>
In his will, dated <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1360, Cardinal Talairand, bishop of Albano, speaks
of the English embroideries on a costly set of white vestments.<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> Ghini,
by birth a Florentine, but, in the year 1343, bishop of Tournai, bequeathed
to that cathedral an old English cope, as well as a beautiful
corporal of English work&mdash;“cappam veterem cum imaginibus et frixio
operis Anglicani. Item unum corporale de opere Anglicano pulchrum,”
&amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> Among the copes reserved for prelates’ use in the chapel of Charles,
Duke of Bourgogne, brother-in-law to our John Duke of Bedford, there
was one of English work, very elaborately fraught with many figures, as
appears from this description of it: “une chappe de brodeure d’or, façon
d’Engleterre, à plusieurs histoires de N.D. et anges et autres ymages,
estans en laceures escriptes, garnie d’un orfroir d’icelle façon fait à apostres,
desquelles les manteulx sont tous couvers de perles, et leur diadesmes
pourphiler de perles, estans en manière de tabernacles, faits de deux arbres,
dont les tiges sont toutes couvertes de perles et à la dite chappe y a une
bille des dites armes, garnie de perles comme la dessus dicte.”<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p>

<p>Besides textiles, leather was at one time the material upon which our
embroiderers exercised the needle; and the Exeter inventory, drawn up
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1277, mentions, for its bier, a large pillow covered with leather
figured with flowers: “magnum cervical co-opertum coreo cum floribus.”<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></p>

</div>

<p>While so coveted abroad, our English embroidery was highly prized
and well paid for here at home. Henry III. had a chasuble embroidered
by Mabilia of Bury St. Edmund’s;<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> and Edward II. paid a hundred
marks&mdash;a good round sum in those days&mdash;to Rose, the wife of John de
Bureford, a citizen and mercer of London, for a choir-cope of her embroidering,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_c">[Pg c]</span>
and which was to be sent to Rome for the Pope as an
offering from the queen.<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>

<p>Though English embroidery fell on a sudden from its high estate, it
never died. All along through those years, wasted with the wars of the
Roses, the work of the English needle was very poor, very coarse, and, so
to say, ragged; as, for instance, the chasuble here, No. <a href="#h-4045">4045</a>, p. 88.
Nothing whatsoever of the celebrated chain-stitch with dimpled faces in
the figures can be found about it. Every part was done in the feather-stitch,
slovenly put down, with some few exceptions, among which may
be enumerated the three rich English copes with pointed hoods running,
like one here, <a href="#Page_207">p. 207</a>, through the orphreys, still to be seen in the Chapter
Library at Durham, and other vestments of the period in private hands.
During the early part of the seventeenth century our embroiderers again
struck out for themselves a new style, which consisted in throwing up
their figures a good height above the grounding. Of this raised work
there is a fine specimen in the fourth of those Durham copes. It is said
to have been wrought for and given by Charles I. to that cathedral.
This red silk vestment is well sprinkled with bodiless cherubic heads
crowned with rays and borne up by wings; while upon the hood is
shown David, who is holding in one hand Goliath’s severed head; and
the whole is done in highly raised embroidery. Belonging to a few of
our aristocracy are bibles of the large folio size, covered in rich white
silk or satin, and embroidered with the royal arms done in bold raised-work.
Each of such volumes is said to have been a gift from that
prince to a forefather of the man who now owns it; and a very fine one
we lately saw at Ham House.</p>

<p>This style of raised embroidery remained in use for many years; and
even yet to be found are certain quaint old looking-glasses, the broad
frames of which are overlaid with this kind of raised embroidery, sometimes
setting forth, as in the specimen No. <a href="#h-892">892</a>, p. 319, of the Brooke
collection here, the story of Ahasuerus and Esther, or a passage in some
courtship carried on after the manners of Arcadia.<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Occasionally on work of an earlier period, some element or another
of this raised style may be found; for instance, in that fine Rhenish embroidery,
Nos. <a href="#h-1194">1194-5</a>, p. 21, the bushiness of hair on all the angels’
heads, is striking, but this is done with little locks of auburn coloured
silk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_ci">[Pg ci]</span></p>

<p>But a very few people, at the present moment, have the faintest idea
about the labour, the money, the length of time often bestowed of old
upon embroideries which had been sketched as well as wrought by the
hands of men, each in his own craft the ablest and most cunning of
that day. In behalf of this our own land, we may gather evidences
strewed all over the present Introduction: as a proof of the self-same
doings elsewhere, may be set forth a remarkable passage given, in his
life of Antonio Pollaiuolo, by Vasari, where he says: “For San Giovanni
in Florence there were made certain very rich vestments after
the design of this master, namely, two dalmatics, a chasuble, and a cope,
all of gold-wove velvet with pile upon pile&mdash;di broccato riccio sopra
riccio&mdash;each woven of one entire piece and without seam, the bordering
and ornaments being stories from the life of St. John, embroidered with
the most subtile mastery of that art by Paolo da Verona, a man most
eminent of his calling, and of incomparable ingenuity: the figures are
no less ably executed with the needle than they would have been if
Antonio had painted them with the pencil; and for this we are largely
indebted to the one master for his design, as well as to the other for his
patience in embroidering it. This work took twenty-six years for its
completion, being wholly in close stitch&mdash;questi ricami fatti con punto
serrato&mdash;which, to say nothing of its durability, makes the work appear
as if it were a real picture limned with the pencil; but the excellent
method of which is now all but lost, the custom being in these days to
make the stitches much wider&mdash;il punteggiare piu largo&mdash;whereby the
work is rendered less durable and much less pleasing to the eye.”<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> These
vestments may yet be seen framed and glazed in presses around the
sacristy of San Giovanni.<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> Antonio died <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1498. The magnificent
cope once belonging to Westminster Abbey, and now at Stonyhurst and
exhibited here, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1862, is of one seamless piece of gorgeous gold
tissue figured with bold wide-spreading foliage in crimson velvet, pile
upon pile, and dotted with small gold spots; it came, it is likely,
from the same loom that threw off these San Giovanni vestments, at
Florence.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Our Old English Opus Consutum, or
Cut Work</span>,</h3>

<p>in French, “appliqué,” is a term of rather wide meaning, as it takes in
several sorts of decorative accompaniments to needlework.</p>

<p>When anything&mdash;flower, fruit, or figure&mdash;is wrought by itself upon a
separate piece of silk or canvas, and afterwards sewed on to the vestment
for church use, or article for domestic purpose, it comes to be known as
“cut-work.” Though often mixed with embroidery, and oftener still
employed by itself upon liturgical garments; oftenest of all, it is to be
found in bed-curtains, hangings for rooms and halls, hence called
“hallings,” and other items in household furniture.</p>

<p>Of cut-work in embroidery, those pieces of splendid Rhenish needlework
with the blazonment of Cleves, all sewed upon a ground of crimson
silk, as we see, <a href="#h-1194">Nos. 1194-5</a>, p. 21. The chasuble of crimson double-pile
velvet, No. <a href="#h-78">78</a>, p. 1, affords another good example. The niches in
which the saints stand are loom-wrought, but those personages themselves
are exquisitely done on separate pieces of fine canvass, and afterwards let
into the unwoven spaces left open for them.</p>

<p>A Florentine piece of cut-work, No. <a href="#h-5788">5788</a>, p. 111, is alike remarkable
for its great beauty, and the skill shown in bringing together so nicely,
weaving and embroidery. Much of the architectural accessories is
loom-wrought, while the extremities of the evangelists are all done by
the needle; but the head, neck, and long beard are worked by themselves
upon very fine linen, and afterwards put together after such a way that
the full white beard overlaps the tunic. Another and a larger example,
from Florence, of the same sort, is furnished us at No. <a href="#h-78">78</a>, p. 1. Quite
noteworthy too is the old and valuable vestment, <a href="#h-673">No. 673</a>, p. 5, in this
regard, for parts of the web in the back orphrey were left open, in the
looms for the heads, and extremities of the figures there, to be done
afterwards in needlework. Such a method of weaving was practised in
parts of Germany, and the web from the looms of Cologne, No. <a href="#h-1329">1329</a>,
p. 61, exhibits an example.</p>

<p>Other methods were bade to come and yield a quicker help in this
cut-work. To be more expeditious, all the figures were at once shaped
out of woven silk, satin, velvet, linen, or woollen cloth as wanted, and
sewed upon the grounding of the article. Upon the personages thus
fashioned in silk, satin, or linen, the features of the face and the contours
of the body were wrought by the needle in very narrow lines done in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ciii">[Pg ciii]</span>
brown silk thread. At times, even thus much of embroidery was set
aside for the painting brush, and instances are to be found in which the
spaces left uncovered by the loom for the heads and extremities of the
human figures, are filled in by lines from the brush.</p>

<p>Often, too, the cut-work done in these ways is framed, as it were,
with an edging, either in plain or gilt leather, hempen, or silken cord,
exactly like the leadings of a stained glass window.</p>

<p>Belonging to ourselves is an old English chasuble, the broad cross, at
the back of which is figured with “The Resurrection of the Body.”
The dead are arising from their graves, and each is wrought in satin, upon
which the features on the face, and the lineaments of the rest of the
body, are shown by thin lines worked with the needle in dark brown
silk; and the edge, where each figure is sewed on the grounding, is
covered with a narrow black silk cord, after much the same fashion as
the lectern-veil here, <a href="#h-7468">No. 7468</a>, p. 141, of silk and gold cut work.
Instances there are wherein, instead of needlework, painting was resorted
to; <a href="#h-8315">No. 8315</a>, p. 189, shows us a fine art-work in its way, upon
which we see the folds of the white linen garment worn by our Lord,
marked by brown lines put in with the brush, while the head and extremities,
and the ground strewed with flowers, are wrought with the
needle. No. <a href="#h-8687">8687</a>, p. 258, gives us a figure where the whole of
the person, the fleshes and clothing, are done in woven silk cut out,
shaded and featured in colours by the brush with some little needlework
here and there upon the garments. In that old specimen,
No. <a href="#h-8713">8713</a>, p. 270, such parts of the design as were meant to be white
are left uncovered upon the linen, and the shading is indicated by brown
lines.</p>

<p>Perhaps in no collection open anywhere to public view could be found
a piece of cut-work so full of teaching about the process, and its easy
way of execution, as the one here, <a href="#h-1370">No. 1370</a>, p. 76; to it we earnestly
recommend the attention of such of our readers as may wish to learn
all about this method.</p>

<p>For the invention of cut-work or “di commesso,” as Vasari calls it,
that writer tells us we are indebted to one of his Florentine countrymen:
“It was by Sandro Botticelli that the method of preparing banners
and standards in what is called cut-work, was invented; and this he did
that the colours might not sink through, showing the tint of the cloth
on each side. The baldachino of Orsanmichele is by this master, and is
so treated,” &amp;c., and this work serves to show how much more effectually
that mode of proceeding preserves the cloth than do those
mordants, which, corroding the surface, allow but a short life to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_civ">[Pg civ]</span>
work; but as the mordants cost less, they are more frequently used in
our day than the first-mentioned method.<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a></p>

<p>However accurate such a statement may be regarding Italy in general,
and Tuscany in particular, it is, nevertheless, utterly untrue as applicable
to the rest of the world. In this collection may be seen a valuable piece
of this same cut-work&mdash;or as Vasari would call it “di commesso”&mdash;by
French hands, fraught with a story out of our English Romance, and
done towards the end of the fourteenth century, <a href="#h-1370">No. 1370</a>, p. 76.
Now, as Botticelli was born <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1457, and died <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1515, he came
into being almost a whole century too late to have originated such a
process of ornamental needlework, which was well known and practised
in these parts so many years before the birth of that Florentine painter.</p>

</div>

<p>There are some accessories, in mediæval embroidery, which ought
not to be overlooked here.</p>

<p>In some few instances,</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Gold, and Silver gilt</span>,</h3>

<p>in very many more, wrought after the smith’s cunning into little star-like
flowers&mdash;broader, bigger, and more craftily fashioned than our modern
spangles&mdash;are to be found sewed upon the silks or amid the embroidery
in the specimens before us, particularly those from Venice and its main-land
provinces in Italy, and from Southern Germany. At <a href="#h-8274">No. 8274</a>,
pp. 168-9, we have a part of an orphrey embroidered on parchment, and
having along with its coral, gold beads, and seed pearls, small bosses and
ornaments in gilded silver stars; it is Venetian, and of the second half
of the twelfth century. <a href="#h-8307">No. 8307</a>, pp. 185-6 is a linen amice, the
silken apparel of which has sewed to it large spangle-like plates in gilded
silver struck with a variety of patterns, showing how the goldsmith’s
hand had been sought by the Germans of the fifteenth century to give
beauty to this silken stuff. The fine piece of ruby-tinted Genoa velvet,
which was once the apparel for the lower hem of an alb, is sprinkled
somewhat thickly with six-rayed stars of gold and silver; but those made
of the latter metal have turned almost black: here we have a sample of
Lombard taste in this matter, of the ending of the fifteenth century.
Silver-gilt spangles wrought to figure six-petalled flowers on a fine
example of gold tissue, under <a href="#h-8588">No. 8588</a>, pp. 222-3, present us with a
German craftsman’s work, in the fourteenth century. <a href="#h-8612">No. 8612</a>,
p. 233, is not without its value in reference to Italian taste. All over,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_cv">[Pg cv]</span>
this curious now fragmental piece of silk damask, has at one time been
thickly strewed with trefoils cut out of gilt metal, but very thin, and not
sewed but glued on to the silk: many of these leaves have fallen off,
and those remaining turned black.</p>

<p>From among these examples a few will show the reader how the
goldsmith had been tasked to work upon them as jeweller also, and gem
the liturgical garments to which these shreds belong, with real or imitated
precious stones. In the orphrey upon the back of that very rich fine
crimson velvet chasuble, <a href="#h-1375">No. 1375</a>, pp. 81-2, the crossed nimb about our
Lord’s head is gemmed with stones set in silver gilt; and the sockets still
left on the piece of crimson velvet, <a href="#h-8334">No. 8334</a>, p. 199, unmistakably
speak for themselves.</p>

<p>Besides precious stones, coral, and seed-pearls,</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Glass</span>,</h3>

<p>coloured and wrought into small beads and bugles, is another of those
hard materials, the presence of which we find in this collection. As
now, so far back during the mediæval period, the Venetians, at the
island of Murano, wrought small glass beads and bugles of all colours, as
well as pastes&mdash;smalti&mdash;in every tint for mosaics, and imitations of jewels.
This art, which they had learned from the Greeks, they followed with
signal success; and likely is it that from Venice came the several
specimens of glass&mdash;blue, like lapis lazuli&mdash;which we still see on that
beautiful frontal in Westminster Abbey,<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>&mdash;the work of our countryman
Peter de Ispagna,<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> the member of an old Essex family. At <a href="#h-8276">No. 8276</a>,
pp. 168-9, is a piece of an orphrey for a chasuble, plentifully embroidered
with glass beads and bugles, which shows how much such a style
of ornament was used towards the latter end of the twelfth century, at
least in Lower Germany, and some of the Italian provinces. Belonging
to St. Paul’s, London, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1295, among many other amices, there was
one having glass stones upon it; “amictus ... ornatus lapidibus
vitreis magnis et parvis per totum in capsis argenteis deauratis, &amp;c.”<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Enamel.</span></h3>

<p>Another form of glass fastened by heat to gold and copper&mdash;enamel,
the invention neither of Egypt, Greece, nor Italy, but of our own old
Britons,<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> was extensively employed as an adornment upon textiles.
Besides the examples we have given,<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> that gorgeous “chesable of red cloth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_cvi">[Pg cvi]</span>
of gold with orphreys before and behind set with pearls, blue, white
and red, with plates of gold enamelled, wanting fifteen plates, &amp;c.”<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a>
bestowed by John of Gaunt’s duchess of Lancaster, upon Lincoln
Cathedral, is another instance to show how such a kind of rich ornamentation
was sewed to garments, especially for church use, in such
large quantities.</p>

<p>Here, in England, the old custom was to sew a great deal of goldsmith’s
work, for enrichment, upon articles meant for personal wear, as
well as on ritual garments. When our first Edward’s grave, in Westminster
Abbey, was opened, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1774, on the body of the king, besides
other silken robes, was seen, a stole-like band of rich white tissue put
about the neck, and crossed upon his breast: it was studded with gilt
quatrefoils in filigree work and embroidered with pearls. From the knees
downwards the body was wrapped in a pall of cloth of gold. Concerning
attire for liturgical use, the fact may be verified in those instances
we have elsewhere given.<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> When Henry III., in the latter end of his
reign, bestowed a frontal on the high altar in Westminster Abbey,
besides carbuncles in golden settings, as we have just read, <a href="#Page_xxxvi">p. xxxvi</a>, we
may have observed that along with several larger pieces of enamel, there
were as many as 866 smaller ones&mdash;the “esmaux de plique” of the
French&mdash;all fastened on this liturgical embroidery.</p>

<p>A good instance of the appliance of figured solid gold or silver, upon
church vestments, is the following one of a cope beaten all over with
lions in silver, given by a well-wisher to Glastonbury Abbey:&mdash;“dederat
unam capam rubeam cum leonibus laminis argenteis capæ infixis, &amp;c.”<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></p>

<p>In the Norman-French, for so long a period in use at our Court,
silken stuffs thus ornamented were said to be “batuz,” or as we now
say beaten with hammered-up gold. Among the liturgical furniture
provided by Richard II. for the chapel in the castle of Haverford, were
“ii rydell batuz”&mdash;two altar-curtains beaten (no doubt with ornaments
in gilt silver.)<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a></p>

<p>For the secular employment of this same sort of decoration, we have
several curious examples. Our ladies’ dresses for grand occasions were
so adorned, as we may see in the verses following:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1215 our King John sent an order to Reginald de Cornhull and
William Cook to have made for him, besides five tunics, five banners
with his arms upon them, well beaten in gold: “quinque banerias de
armis nostris bene auro bacuatas” (<i>sic</i>).<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> The <i>c</i> for <i>t</i> must be a misprint
in the last word.</p>

<p>An amice at St. Paul’s had on it the figures of two bishops and a
king hammered up out of gilt silver: “amictus ornatus cum duobus
magnis episcopis et uno rege stantibus argenteis deauratis.”<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></p>

<p>From the original bill for fitting out one of the ships in which Beauchamp,
Earl of Warwick, during the reign of Henry VI., went over
to France, where he had been appointed to a high command, we
gather hints which throw light upon this as well as several matters
belonging to this Introduction. Among other items for the above-named
equipage are these:&mdash;“Four hundred pencils (long narrow strips, may be
of silk, used as flags), beat with the Raggedstaff in silver; the other
pavys (one of two shields, likely of wood, and fastened outside the ship
at its bows), painted with black, and a Raggedstaff beat with silver
occupying all the field; one coat (perhaps of silk, but no doubt blazoned
with the Beauchamp’s arms,) for my Lord’s body, beat with fine gold;
two coats (like the foregoing) for heralds, beat with demi gold; a great
streamer for a ship of forty yeards in length and eight yeards in breadth, with
a great Bear and Griffin holding a Raggedstaff poudred full of Raggedstaffs;
three penons (small flags) of satten; sixteen standards of worsted entailed
with the Bear and a chain.”<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> The quatrefoils on the robe of our First
Edward, the silver lions on the Glastonbury cope, the beasts and birds on
the lady’s gown, the Bear, and Griffin, and Raggedstaff belonging to the
Beauchamp’s blazoning, and all such like enrichments&mdash;mostly heraldic&mdash;put
upon silken stuffs, were cut out of very thin plates of gold or silver,
so as to hang upon them lightly, and were hammered up to show in low
relief the fashion of the flower and the lineaments of the beast or bird
meant to be represented.</p>

<p>In fact, such a style of ornamentation done in gold or silver, stitched
on silken stuffs made up into liturgical garments, knights’ coats of arms,
ladies’ dresses, heralds’ tabards, or flags and penoncels, was far more
common once than is now thought. It had struck out for itself a technical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_cviii">[Pg cviii]</span>
expression. In speaking of it men would either write or say, “silk
beaten with gold or silver,” as the case might be&mdash;a meaning, by the
way, for the word “beat,” quite overlooked by our lexicographers; yet,
making her will as late as the year 1538, Barbara Mason bequeathed to
a church “a vestment of grene sylke betyn with goold.”<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></p>

<p>The badge on the arm of the livery coat once commonly worn, and
yet rowed for by the Thames watermen, as well as the armorials figured,
before and behind, upon the fine old picturesque frocks of our buffetiers&mdash;the
yeomen of the Royal guard, called in London “beefeaters,”&mdash;help
to keep up the tradition of such a style of ornament in dress.</p>

<p><i>Spangles</i>, when they happened to be used, were not like such as are
now employed, but fashioned after another and artistic shape, and put
on in a different manner. Before me lies a shred from the chasuble
belonging to the set of vestments wrought, it is said, by Isabella of
Spain and her maids of honour, and worn the first time high mass was
sung in Granada, after it had been taken by the Spaniards from the
Moors. Upon this shred are flowers, well thrown up in relief, done in
spangles on a crimson velvet ground. These spangles&mdash;some in gold,
some in silver&mdash;are, though small, in several sizes; all are voided&mdash;that
is, hollow in the middle&mdash;with the circumference not flat, but convex,
and are sewed on like tiles one overlapping the other, and thus produce
a rich and pleasing effect. Our present spangles, in the flat shape,
are quite modern.</p>

<p>Sadly overlooked, or but scantily employed on modern embroideries,
is the process of</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Diapering</span>,</h3>

<p>after so many graceful and ever-varying forms to be found almost always
upon mediæval works of the needle.</p>

<p>The garments worn by high personages in the embroidery, and meant
to imitate a golden textile, were done in gold <i>passing</i> sometimes by
itself, sometimes with coloured silk thread laid down alternately aside it,
so as to lend a tinge of green, crimson, pink, or blue, to the imagined
tissue of the robe, as if it were made of a golden stuff shot with the
adopted tint.</p>

<p>For putting on this gold passing, it was of course required to sew it
down. Now, from this very needful and mechanical requirement, those
mediæval needlewomen sought and got an admirable as well as ingenious
element of ornamentation, and so truthful too. Of this our ladies at
this day, seem, from their work, to have a very narrow, short idea.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_cix">[Pg cix]</span>
Taking thin (usually red) silk, and while fastening the golden or silver
passing, they dotted it all over in small stitches set exactly after a way that
showed the one same pattern. So teeming were their brains in this
matter that hardly the same design in diapering is twice to be found
upon the same embroidered picture. With no other appliance they
were thus enabled to lend to their draperies the appearance of having
been, not wrought by the needle, but actually cut out of a piece of textile,
and for which they have been sometimes mistaken.</p>

<p>Of the many samples here of this kind of diapering we select one or
two&mdash;<a href="#h-1194">Nos. 1194-5</a>, p. 21, which is so very fine, and of itself quite
enough for showing what we wish to point out, and to warrant our
praises of the method; <a href="#h-8837">No. 8837</a>, p. 200, is another worth attention.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Thread Embroidery</span>,</h3>

<p>after several of its modes, is represented here; and though the specimens
are not many, some of them are splendid.</p>

<p>By our English women, hundreds of years gone by, among other
applications of the needle, one was to darn upon linen netting or work
thereon with other kinds of stitchery, religious subjects for Church-use;
or flowers and animals for household furniture.</p>

<p>In this country such a sort of embroidering was called net-work&mdash;filatorium&mdash;as
we learn from the Exeter Inventory, where we read that
its cathedral possessed, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1327, three pieces of it, for use at the altar&mdash;one
in particular for throwing over the desk: “tria filatoria linea, unde
unum pro desco.”<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> From their liturgical use, as we have noticed, p. <a href="#Page_212">212</a>,
they were more generally named lectern-veils, and as such are spoken
of, in the same Devonshire document: “i lectionale de panno lineo
operato de opere acuali, &amp;c.”<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> Of those narrow, light, and moveable
lecterns over which these linen embroideries were cast, Exeter had three&mdash;two
of wood, another which folded up (see p. <a href="#Page_212">212</a> here,) of iron:
“i descus volubilis de ferro, pro Evangelio supra legendo; ii alia lectrina
lignea.”<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></p>

<p>Almost every one of these thread embroideries were wrought during
the fourteenth century, and several of them for the service of the sanctuary,
either as reredos, frontal, or lectern-veil; and while those described
at pp. <a href="#Page_19">19</a>, <a href="#Page_20">20</a>, <a href="#Page_31">31</a>, <a href="#Page_53">53</a>, <a href="#Page_60">60</a>, <a href="#Page_71">71</a>, <a href="#Page_99">99</a>, <a href="#Page_120">120</a>, <a href="#Page_242">242-3</a>, <a href="#Page_249">249</a>, <a href="#Page_261">261-7</a>, deserve

two very fine ones under Nos. <a href="#h-8358">8358</a>, p. 210, and <a href="#h-8618">8618</a>, p. 235. As
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_cx">[Pg cx]</span>
early as <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1295, St. Paul’s had a cushion covered with knotted

guided by taste, a work of real, though humble art, may be brought
out and shewn upon any article, from a lady’s skirt to a gentleman’s
daily skull-cap, by such a use of the needle.</p>

<p><i>Crochet</i>, knitting done with linen thread, and in the convents throughout
Flanders, as well as the thick kinds of lace wrought there upon the
cushion with bobbins, came, under the name of nun’s lace, to be everywhere
much employed, from the sixteenth century and upwards, for bordering
altar-cloths, albs, and every sort of towel required in the celebration
of the liturgy. <a href="#h-1358">No. 1358</a>, p. 72, is a good example.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">
Though</span> regarding actual time so very old, still in comparison
with weaving and embroidery, the art of tapestry
is, it would seem, the youngest of the three.</p>

<p>It is neither real weaving, nor true embroidery, but unites
in its working those two processes into one. Though wrought in a loom
and upon a warp stretched out along its frame, it has no woof thrown
across those threads with a shuttle or any like appliance, but its weft is
done with many short threads, all variously coloured, and put in by a
kind of needle. It is not embroidery, though so very like it, for tapestry
is not worked upon what is really a web&mdash;having both warp and woof&mdash;but
upon a series of closely set fine strings.</p>

<p>From the way in which tapestry is spoken of in Holy Writ, we are
sure the art must be very old; but if it did not take its first rise in Egypt,
we are led by the same authority to conclude that it soon became much
and successfully cultivated by the people of that land. The woman in
Proverbs vii. 16, says:&mdash;“I have woven my bed with cords. I have
covered it with painted tapestry, brought from Egypt.” While, therefore,
in those words we hear how it used to be employed as an article of
household furniture among the Israelites, by them are we also told that
the Egyptians were the makers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_cxi">[Pg cxi]</span></p>

<p>Like weaving and fine needlework, the art of tapestry came from
Egypt and Asia, westward; and in the days of Virgil our old British
sires were employed in the theatres at Rome as scene-shifters, where
they had to take away those tapestries on which they themselves, as
examples of imperial triumph, had been figured:&mdash;</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>From Egypt through Western Asia the art of tapestry-making found
its way to Europe, and at last to us; and among the other manual
labours followed by their rule in religious houses, this handicraft was one,
and the monks became some of its best workmen. The altars and the
walls of their churches were hung with such an ornamentation. Matthew
Paris tells us, that among other ornaments which, in the reign of Henry
I, Abbot Geoffrey had made for his church of St. Alban’s monastery,
were three reredoses, the first a large one wrought with the finding of
England’s protomartyr’s body; the other two smaller-ones figured with
the gospel story of the man who fell among thieves, the other with that
of the prodigal son: “dedit quoque dossale magnum in quo intexitur
inventio Sancti Albani, cujus campus est aerius, et aliud minus ubi effigiatur
Evangelium de sauciato qui incidit in latrones, et tertium ubi
historia de filio prodigo figuratur.”<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> While in London, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1316,
Simon Abbot, of Ramsey, bought for his monks’ use looms, staves,
shuttles and a slay: “pro weblomes emptis xx<sup>s</sup>. Et pro staves ad
easdem vj<sup>d</sup>. Item pro iiij shittles pro eodem opere ij<sup>s</sup> vj<sup>d</sup>. Item in j.
slay pro textoribus viij<sup>d</sup>.”<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p>

<p>What was done in one monastery was but the reflex of every other;
hence, Giffard, one of the commissioners for the suppression of the
smaller houses, in the reign of Henry VIII., thus writes to Cromwell,
while speaking of the monastery of Wolstrope, in Lincolnshire:&mdash;“Not
one religious person there but that he can and doth use either imbrothering,
writing books with very fair hand, making their own garments,
carving, painting, or graving, &amp;c.”<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></p>

<p>Pieces of English-made tapestry still remain. That fine, though
mutilated specimen at St. Mary’s Hall, Coventry, is one; a second is the
curious reredos for an altar, belonging to the London Vintners’ Company;
it is figured with St. Martin on horseback cutting with his sword
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_cxii">[Pg cxii]</span>
his cloak in two, that he might give one-half to a beggar man; and with
St. Dunstan singing mass, and wrought by the monks of St. Alban’s.</p>

<p>Though practised far and wide, the art of weaving tapestry became
most successfully followed in many parts of France and throughout
ancient Flanders where secular trade-gilds were formed for its especial
manufacture, in many of its towns. Several of these cities won for
themselves an especial fame; but so far, at last, did Arras outrun them
all that arras-work came, in the end, to be the common word, both here
and on the Continent, to mean all sorts of tapestry, whether wrought in
England or abroad. Thus is it, we think, that those fine hangings for
the choir of Canterbury Cathedral, now at Aix-en-Provence, though
made at home, perhaps too by his own monks, and given to that church
by Prior Goldston, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1595, are spoken of as, not indeed from Arras,
but arras-work&mdash;“pannos pulcherrimos opere de arysse subtiliter intextos.”<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></p>

<p>Arras is but one among several other terms by which, during the
middle ages, tapestry was called.</p>

<p>From the Saracens, it is likely Western Europe learned the art: at all
events its earliest name in Christendom was Saracenic work&mdash;“opus
Saracenicum”&mdash;and as our teachers, we too wrought in a low or horizontal
loom. The artizans of France and Flanders were the first to
bring forwards the upright or vertical frame, afterwards known abroad
as “de haute lisse,” in contradistinction to the low or horizontal frame
called “de basse lisse.” Those who went on with the latter unimproved
loom, though thorough good Christians, came to be known, in the trade,
as Saracens, for keeping to the method of their paynim teachers; and
their produce, Saracenic. In year 1339 John de Croisettes, a Saracen-tapestry
worker, living at Arras, sells to the Duke of Touraine a piece
of gold Saracenic tapestry figured with the story of Charlemaine:
“Jean de Croisettes, tapissier Sarrazinois demeurant à Arras, vend au
Duc de Touraine un tapis Sarrazinois à or de l’histoire de Charlemaine.”<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a>
Soon however the high frame put out of use the low one; and among
the many pieces of tapestry belonging to Philippe Duke of Bourgogne
and Brabant, very many are especially entered as of the high frame, and
one of them is thus described:&mdash;“ung grant tapiz de haulte lice, sauz
or, de l’istoire du duc Guillaume de Normandie comment il conquist
Engleterre.”<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_cxiii">[Pg cxiii]</span></p>

<p>With the upright, as with the flat frame, the workman went the same
road to his labours; but, in either of these ways, had to grope in the
dark a great deal on his path. In both, he was obliged to put in the
threads on the back or wrong side of the piece following his sketch as
best he could behind the fixings or warp. As the face was downward
in the flat frame he had no means of looking at it to correct a fault.
In the upright frame he might go in front, and with his own doings in
open view on one hand, and the original design full before him on the
other, he could mend as he went on, step by step, the smallest mistake,
were it but a single thread. Put side by side, when done, the pieces
from the upright frame were, in beauty and perfection, far beyond those
that had come from the flat one. In what that superiority consisted
we do not know with certitude, for not one single flat sample, truly such,
is recognizable from evidence within our reach.</p>

<p>To us it seems that the Saracenic work was in texture light and thin,
so that it might be, as it often was, employed for making vestments themselves,
or sewed instead of needlework embroidered on those liturgical
appliances. In the inventory of St. Paul’s, London, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1295, mention
is made of it thus: “Duo amicti veteres quorum unus de opere Saraceno.”<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>

<p>Of the tapestries in this collection, perhaps Nos. <a href="#h-1296">1296</a>, p. 296, and
<a href="#h-1465">1465</a>, p. 298, may be of the so-called Saracenic kind, because wrought
in the low flat loom, or, “de basse lisse,” while all the rest are assuredly
of the “dehaute lisse,” or done in the upright frame.</p>

<p>When the illuminators of MSS. began&mdash;and it was mostly in Flanders&mdash;to
put in golden shadings all over their painting, their fellow-countrymen,
the tapestry-workers, did the same.</p>

<p>Such a manner, in consequence, cannot be relied on as any criterion
whereby to judge of the exact place where any specimen of tapestry had
been wrought, or to tell its precise age. To work figures on a golden
ground, and to shade garments, buildings, and landscapes with gold,
are two different things.</p>

<p>Upon several pieces here gold thread has been very plentifully used,
but the metal is of so debased a quality that it has become almost black.</p>

<p>For Church decoration and household furniture the use of tapestry,
both here and abroad, was&mdash;nay, on the Continent still is&mdash;very great.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_cxiv">[Pg cxiv]</span>
The many large pieces, mostly of a scriptural character, provided by
Cardinal Wolsey for his palace at Hampton Court, were very fine. The
most beautiful collection in the world&mdash;the Arazzi&mdash;now in the Vatican
at Rome, may be judged of by looking at a few of the original cartoons
at present in the Museum, drawn and coloured by Raffael’s own hand.
Duke Cosimo tried to set up tapestry work at Florence, but did not
succeed. Later, Rome produced some good things; among others, the
fine copy of Da Vinci’s Last Supper still hung up on Maundy Thursday.
England herself made like attempts&mdash;first at Mortlake, then years afterwards
in London, at Soho. Works from these two establishments may
be met with. At Northumberland House there is a room all hung
with large pieces of tapestry wrought at Soho, and for that place, in
the year 1758. The designs were done by Francesco Zuccherelli, and
consist of landscapes composed of hills crowned here and there with
the standing ruins of temples, or strewed with broken columns, among
which are wandering and amusing themselves groups of country folks.
Mortlake and Soho were failures. Not so the Gobelins at Paris, as
may be observed in the beautifully executed specimens in the Museum. As
now, so in ages gone by, pieces of tapestry were laid down for carpeting.</p>

<p>In many of our old-fashioned houses&mdash;in the country in particular&mdash;good
samples of Flemish tapestry may be found. Close to London,
Holland House is adorned with some curious specimens, especially in the
raised style.</p>

<p>Imitated tapestry&mdash;if paintings on canvas may be so called&mdash;existed
here hundreds of years ago under the name of “stayned cloth,” and
the workers of it were embodied into a London civic gild. Of this
“stayned cloth” we have lately found hangings upon the walls of a
dining-room in one mansion; in another ornamenting, with great effect,
the top of a stair-case.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the sixteenth century Exeter Cathedral had several
pieces of old painted or “stayned” cloth: “i pannus veteratus depictus
cum ymaginibus Sancti Andree in medio et Petri et Pauli ex lateribus; i
front stayned cum crucifixo, Maria et Johanne, Petro et Paulo; viij
parvi panni linei stayned, &amp;c.”<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a></p>

<p>The very great use at that time of such articles in household furniture
may be witnessed in the will, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1503, of Katherine Lady Hastings,
who bequeaths, besides several other such pieces, “an old hangin of
counterfeit arres of Knollys, which now hangeth in the hall, and all such
hangyings of old bawdekyn, or lynen paynted as now hang in the chappell.”<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Carpets</span></h3>

<p>are somewhat akin to tapestry, and though the use of them may perhaps
be not so ancient, yet is very old. Here, again, to the people of Asia,
must we look for the finest as well as earliest examples of this textile.
Few are the mediæval specimens of it anywhere, and we are glad to
recommend attention to two pieces of that period fortunately in the collection,
<a href="#h-8649">No. 8649</a>, p. 248, of the fourteenth century, and <a href="#h-8357">No. 8357</a>,
p. 209, of the sixteenth, both of Spanish make.</p>

<p>As even the antechambers of our royal palaces, so the chancels in
most of our country parish churches used to be strewed with rushes.
When, however, they could afford it, the authorities of our cathedrals,
even in Anglo-Saxon times, sought to spread the sanctuary with carpets;
and at last old tapestry came to be so employed, as now in Italy. Among
such coverings for the floor before the altar, Exeter had a large piece of
Arras cloth figured with the life of the Duke of Burgundy, the gift of
one of its bishops, Edmund Lacy, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1420, besides two large carpets,
one bestowed by Bishop Nevill, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1456, the other, of a chequered
pattern, by Lady Elizabeth Courtney: “Carpet et panni coram altari sternendi&mdash;i
pannus de Arys de historia Ducis Burgundie&mdash;i larga carpeta,
&amp;c.”<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> In an earlier inventory, we find that among the “bancaria,” or
bench-coverings, in the choir of the same cathedral, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1327, one was
a large piece of English-made tapestry, with a fretted pattern&mdash;“unum
tapetum magnum Anglicanum frettatum.”<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> And we think that as the
Record Commission goes on under the Master of the Rolls, to print our
ancient historians, evidences will turn up showing that the looms at work
in all our great monasteries, among other webs, wrought carpets. From
existing printed testimony we know that, in all likelihood, such must
have been the practice at Croyland, where Abbot Egelric, the second of
the name bestowed before the year 992, when he died, upon his church:
“two large foot-cloths (so carpets were then called) woven with lions to
be laid out before the high altar on great festivals, and two shorter ones
trailed all over with flowers, for the feast days of the Apostles: “Dedit
etiam duo magna pedalia leonibus intexta, ponenda ante magnum altare
in festis principalibus et duo breviora floribus respersa pro festis Apostolorum.”<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a>
The quantity of carpeting in our palaces may be seen by the
way in which “my lady the queen’s rooms were strewed with them
‘when she took her chamber.’”<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a></p>

While</span> telling of a coronation, a royal marriage, the queen’s
‘taking her chamber,’ her after-churching, a baptism, a progress,
or a funeral, the historian or the painter cannot bring
before his own mind, much less set forth to ours, a fit idea
of the circumstances in the splendour shown on any one of these imperial
occasions, unless he can see old samples of those cloths of gold, figured
velvets, curious embroidery, and silken stuffs, such as are gathered in this
collection, and used to be worn of old for those functions.</p>

<p>Of the many valuable, though indirect uses to which this curious
collection of textiles may, on occasions, be turned, a few there are to
which we call particular attention, for the ready help it is likely to afford.
In the first place, to</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Historian</span>,</h3>

<p>in some at least of his researches, as he not only writes of bloodshed
and of wars, that make or unmake kings, but follows his countrymen in
private life through their several ways onward to civilization and the cultivation
of the arts of peace.</p>

<p>Besides a tiny shred (<a href="#h-675">No. 675</a>, p. 6) of the very needlework itself, we
have here a coloured plaster-cast of one of the figures in the so-called
Bayeux Tapestry, which, among some, it has of late been a fashion to
look upon as a great historic document, because it was, they say, worked
by no less a personage than William’s own queen, Matilda, helped by her
handmaids.</p>

<p>Its present and modern title is altogether a misnomer. It is needlework,
and no tapestry. Not Normandy, but England, is most likely to
have been the country; not Bayeux, but London, the place wherein it
was wrought. Probabilities forbid us from believing that either Matilda
herself, or her waiting ladies, ever did a stitch on this canvas; nay, it is
likely she never as much as saw it.</p>

<p>Coarse white linen and common worsted would never have been the
materials which any queen would have chosen for such a work by which
her husband’s great achievement was to be celebrated.</p>

<p>But three women are seen upon the work, and Matilda is not one of
them. Surely the dullest courtier would never have forgotten such an
opportunity for a compliment to his royal mistress by putting in her person.</p>

<p>A piece, nineteen inches broad and two hundred and twenty-six feet
long, crowded with fighting men&mdash;some on foot, some on horseback&mdash;with
buildings and castles, must have taken much time and busied
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_cxvii">[Pg cxvii]</span>
many hands for its working. Yet of all this, nought has ever turned
up in any notice of Matilda’s life. She was not, like the Anglo-Saxon
Margaret queen of Scotland, known to fill up her time amidst her
maids with needlework, nor ever stood out a parallel to an older Anglo-Saxon
high-born lady, the noble Ælfleda, of whom we now speak.
Her husband was the famous Northumbrian chieftain, Brithnoth, who
had so often fought and so sorely worsted the invading Danes, by whom
he was at last slain. His loving wife and her women wrought his deeds
of daring in needlework upon a curtain which she gave to the minster
church at Ely, wherein the headless body of her Brithnoth lay buried:
“cortinam gestis viri sui (Brithnothi) intextam atque depictam in
memoriam probitatis ejus, huic ecclesiæ (Eliensi) donavit (Ælfleda).”<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a>
Surely when Ælfleda’s handiwork found a chronicler, that of a queen
would never have gone without one. Moreover, had such a piece any-wise
or ever belonged to William’s wife, we must think that, instead
of being let to stray away to Bayeux, towards which place she bore no
particular affection, she would have bequeathed it, like other things, to
her beloved church at Caen. Yet in her will no notice of it comes,
and the only mention of any needlework is of two English specimens,
one a chasuble bought of Aldaret’s wife at Winchester, and a vestment
then being wrought for her in England: “casulam quam apud Wintoniam
operatur uxor Aldereti ... atque aliud vestimentum quod operatur
in Anglia,” both of which she leaves to the Church of the Holy Trinity
at Caen.</p>

<div class="footnote">

</div>

<p>But there is the tradition that it is Matilda’s doing. True, but it is
barely a hundred years old, and its first appearance was in the year 1730
or so: tradition so young goes then for nothing. Who then got it
worked, and why did it find its way to Bayeux?</p>

<p>Odo, bishop of Bayeux, and own brother to William came himself,
and, like other rich and powerful Norman Lords, brought vassals who
fought at Hastings. Of all the great chiefs, but one, at most but two,
are pointed out by name on this piece. Odo, however, is figured in no
less than three of its compartments; furthermore, three men quite
unknown to fame, Turold, Vital, and Wadard, receive as many times
as the bishop this same honourable distinction. Rich and influential in
Normandy, Odo, after being made Earl of Kent by his victorious
brother, became richer and more influential in England; hence the three
above-mentioned individuals, the prelate’s feudatories, by their master’s
favour, got possession of wide landed estates in many parts of England,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_cxviii">[Pg cxviii]</span>
as appears from Domesday. Coming from Bayeux itself, and owing
service to its bishop, through whom they had become rich lords in
England, these three men may have very naturally wished to make a
joint offering to the cathedral of their native city. Hence they had this
piece of needlework done in London, and on it caused, neither Matilda
nor any of the great chiefs of the Norman expedition, but instead, the
bishop of Bayeux and themselves its citizens to be so conspicuously set
forth upon what was meant to be, for Bayeux itself, a memorial of the
part that the bishop and three men of Bayeux had taken in the Norman
conquest of England.</p>

<p>On second thoughts, we look upon this curious piece as the work of
the early part of the twelfth century, perhaps as an offering to the
new church (the old one having been burned down by our Henry I.
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1106) of Bayeux, as in measurement it exactly fits for hanging both
sides of the present nave, its original as well as recent purpose.</p>

<p>In future, then, our writers may be led to use with caution this so-called
Bayeux Tapestry, as a document contemporaneous with the
Norman conquest.</p>

<p>Though, in the reign of our Henry II. London was the head city of
this kingdom, and the chief home of royalty, some reader may perhaps
be startled on hearing that while its churches were 120, the inhabitants
amounted only to the number of 40,000, as we learn from Peter, its
then archdeacon: “nam quum sint in illa civitate (Londinensi) quadra-ginta
millia hominum, atque centum et viginti ecclesiæ,” &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>&mdash;yet, at
that very time, the capital of Sicily&mdash;Palermo&mdash;by itself was yielding to
its king a yearly revenue quite equal in amount to the whole income of
England’s sovereign, as we are told by Gerald Barry the learned Welsh
writer then living: “Urbs etenim una Siciliæ, Palernica scilicet, plus
certi redditus regi Siculo singulis annis reddere solet, quam Anglorum
regi nunc reddit Anglia tota.”<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> This great wealth was gathered to Sicily
by her trade in silken textiles, first with the Byzantines and the coasts of
Asia Minor and Alexandria, where those stuffs were at the time wrought;
and secondly, with Europe, and the products of her own looms somewhat
later. Many of the pieces in this collection were woven at Palermo and
other cities in that island. She herself was not the least consumer of her
own industry, and of the profuse employment of silk for royal awnings,
during the twelfth century in the kingdom of the two Sicilies. We have
an example in the silken tent, made for queen Joan, and given her by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_cxix">[Pg cxix]</span>
her husband king William, large enough to hold two hundred knights
sitting down to dinner; and which, along with her chair of gold, and
golden table twelve feet long and a foot and a-half wide, her brother, our
Richard I. got back for his sister from Tancred: “Ipse (Richardus rex)
enim a rege Tancredo exigebat&mdash;cathedram auream ad opus ejusdem
Johannæ de consuetudine reginarum illius regni et ad opus sui ipsius
mensam auream de longitudine duodecim pedum, et de latitudine unius
pedis et semis et quoddam tentorium de serico magnum adeo quod ducenti
milites in eo possint simul manducare.”<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a></p>

<p>Among the old copes, dalmatics and chasubles which, one after the
other, find their way at last to collections such as this, must the historian
seek for what remains of those gorgeous robes worn at some interesting
ceremony, or on some stirring occasion, by personages celebrated in our
national annals. For example, along with the several gifts bestowed upon
the church of Ely, by king Edgar, we find mentioned his mantle of
costly purple and gold, of which was made a vestment: “Enimvero
chlamydem suam de insigni purpura ad modum loricæ auro undique contextam
illuc (ecclesiæ Eliensi) contulit rex Ædgarus.”<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> Of a whole
set of mass vestments at Windsor made out of the crimson and gold
cloth powdered with birds, once the array worn by a royal princess when
she was married, we have already spoken.</p>

<p>Queen Philippa gave to Symon, bishop of Ely, the gown she wore at
her churching after the birth of her eldest son the Black Prince. The
garment was of murrey-coloured velvet, powdered with golden squirrels,
and so ample that it furnished forth three copes for choir use: “Contulit

Elizabeth Lady Beauchamp the splendid mantle made of cloth of gold
lined with crimson velvet which Henry V. had on as he rode in state on
horseback through London, the day before his coronation. Also another
gown of green and gold velvet out of both of which vestments were
made: “Elizabeth Beauchamp mulier nobilis ... contulit monasterio
S. Albani quandam togam pretiosissimam auro textam duplicatam
cum panno de velvetto rubeo resperso cum rosis aureis quæ quondam
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_cxx">[Pg cxx]</span>

similiter fuit ejusdem regis.”<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> Naturally wishful to know something
about such costly stuffs, the historian will have to come hither, where he
may find specimens in the gorgeous velvet and gold chasubles in this
collection. Whilst here perchance his eye may wander toward such
pieces as those Nos. <a href="#h-1310">1310</a>, p. 53, and <a href="#h-8624">8624</a>, p. 239, whereon he sees
figured, stags with tall branching horns, couchant, chained, upturning
their antlered heads to sunbeams darting down upon them amid a
shower of rain; and beneath the stags are eagles; p. <a href="#Page_239">239</a>. This
Sicilian textile, woven about the end of the fourteenth century, brings to
his mind that bronze cumbent figure of a king in Westminster Abbey.
It is of Richard II. made for him before his downfal, and by two
coppersmiths of London, Nicholas Broker and Godfrey Prest. This
effigy, once finely gilt, is as remarkable for its beautiful workmanship, as
for the elaborate manner in which the cloak and kirtle worn by the king
are diapered all over with the pattern (now hid under coats of dirt) on
that silken stuff out of which those garments must have been cut for his
personal wear while living; and it consists of a sprig of the Planta
genesta, the humble broom plant&mdash;the haughty Plantagenets’ device&mdash;along
with a couchant hart chained and gazing straight forwards, and
above it a cloud with rays darting up from behind. With Edward III.
Richard’s grandfather, “sunbeams issuing from a cloud” was a favourite
cognizance. The white hart he got from the white hind, the cognizance
of his mother Joan, the fair maid of Kent, and rendered remarkable
by the unflinching steadfastness of the faithful Jenico in wearing it as his
royal master’s badge after Richard’s downfal. Sometimes, did that king
take as a device a white falcon, for, at a tournament held by him at
Windsor, forty of his knights came clothed in green with a white falcon
on the stuff. During a foppish reign, Richard was the greatest fop.
When he sat to those two London citizens for his monument, which they
so ably wrought, and which still is at Westminster, our own belief is that
he wore a dress of silk which had been expressly woven for him at Palermo.
We think, too, that the couple of specimens here, Nos. <a href="#h-1310">1310</a>, p. 53,
and <a href="#h-8624">8624</a>, p. 239, were originally wrought in Sicily, after designs from
England, and for the court of Richard: they quite answer the period,
and show those favourite devices, the chained hart, sunbeams issuing
from a cloud, the falcon or eagle&mdash;a group in itself quite peculiar to that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_cxxi">[Pg cxxi]</span>
monarch. For the slight variations in these stuffs from those upon the
Westminster monument, we will account, a little further on, while
treating the subject of symbolism, Section VII.</p>

<p>The seemliness, not to say comfort, of private life, was improved by
the use, after several ways, of textiles. Let the historian contrast the
manners, even in a royal palace during the twelfth century, with those
that are now followed in every tradesman’s home. Then, rich barons
and titled courtiers would sprawl amid the straw and rushes, strewed in
the houses even of the king, upon the floor in every room, which, as
Wendover says: “junco solent domorum areæ operiri;”<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> and, platting
knots with the litter, fling them with a gibe at the man who had been
slighted by the prince.<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> Not quite a hundred years later, when Eleanor
of Castile came to London for her marriage with our first Edward, she
found her lodgings furnished, under the directions of the Spanish
courtiers who had arrived before her, with hangings and curtains of
silk around the walls, and carpets spread upon the ground. This sorrowed
some of our people; more of them giggled at the thought that
some of these costly things were laid down to be walked upon, as we learn
from Matthew Paris: “Cum venisset illa nurus nobilissima (Alienora)
ad hospitium sibi assignatum invenit illud ... holosericis palliis et tapetiis,
ad similitudinem templi appensis; etiam pavimentum aulæis redimitum,
Hispanis, secundum patriæ suæ forte consuetudinem hoc procurantibus.”<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a>
Now, our houses have a carpet for every room as well as on its stair-case,
and not a few of our shops are carpeted throughout.</p>

<p>The Emperor Aurelian’s wife once tried to coax out of her imperial
husband a silk cloak&mdash;only one silk cloak. “No,” was the answer;
“I could never think,” said that lord of the earth, “of buying such a
thing; it sells for its weight in gold;” as we showed before, p. <a href="#Page_xix">xix</a>.
Now, however, little does the woman of the nineteenth century suspect,
when she goes forth pranked out in all her bravery of dress, that an
Egyptian Cleopatra equally with a Roman empress would have looked
with a grudging eye upon her gay silk gown and satin ribbons; or
that, as late as three hundred years ago, even her silken hose would
have been an offering worthy of an English queen’s (Elizabeth’s)
acceptance. Little, too, does that tall young man who, as he stands
behind the lady’s chariot going to a Drawing-room, ever and anon lets
drop a stealthy but complaisant look upon his own legs shining in soft
blushing silk&mdash;ah! little does he dream that in that old palace before
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_cxxii">[Pg cxxii]</span>
him there once dwelt a king (James I.) of Great Britain, who would
have envied him his bright new stockings; and who, before he came
to the throne of England, was fain to wear some borrowed ones, when in
Scotland he had to receive an English ambassador. If we take this
loan, for the nonce, from the Earl of Mar to his royal master, to have
been as shapeless and befrilled as are the yellow pair (Blue Coat School
boys’ as yet) once Queen Elizabeth’s, now among the curiosities at
Hatfield; then were those stockings&mdash;the first woven in England, and
presented by Lord Hunsdon&mdash;funny things, indeed.</p>

<p>Though so small a thing, there is in this collection a little cushion,
No. <a href="#h-9047">9047</a>, p. 273, which bears in it much more than what shows itself
at first, and is likely to awaken the curiosity of some who may have hereafter
to write about the doings of our Court in the early part of the
seventeenth century. This cushion is needle-wrought and figured all
over with animals, armorial bearings, flowers, and love-knots, together
with the letters I and R royally crowned with a strawberry leaf, and the
strawberry fruit close by each of those capitals, as well as plentifully
sprinkled all over the work.</p>

<p>In Scotland, several noble families, whether they spell their name
<span class="smcap">Fraser</span> or <span class="smcap">Frazer</span>, use as a canting charge&mdash;“arme che cantano”&mdash;of
the Italians; the French “frasier,” or strawberry, leafed, flowered,
fructed proper; the buck too, figured here, comes in or about their
armorial shields. Hence then we are fairly warranted in thinking that it
was a Fraser’s lady hand which wrought this small, but elaborate cushion,
most likely as a gift, and with a strong meaning about it, to our King
James I., whose unicorn is not forgotten here; and, in all probability,
whilst she also wished to indicate that an S was the first letter in her own
baptismal name. Siren too is another term for mermaid&mdash;that emblem
so conspicuously figured by the lady’s side. All this, with the love-knot
so plentifully broadcast and interwoven after many ways, and sprinkled
everywhere as such a favourite device, perhaps may help some future
biographer of James to throw a light over a few hidden passages in the
life of that sovereign.</p>

<p>Human hair, or something very like it, was put into the embroidery
on parts of this small cushion. On the under side, to the left, stands
a lady with her hair lying in rolls about her forehead. After looking well
into them, through a glass, these rolls seem to be real human hair&mdash;may
be the lady’s own&mdash;it is yellow. Peering narrowly into those red roses
close by, seeded and barbed, the seeded part or middle is found to be
worked with two distinct sorts of human hair&mdash;one the very same as the
golden hair on the lady’s brow, the other of a light sandy shade: could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_cxxiii">[Pg cxxiii]</span>
this have been king James’s? His son, Charles I., used, as it would seem,
to send from his prison locks of his own hair to some few of the gentry
favourable to his cause, so that the ladies of that house, while working
his royal portraiture in coloured silks, might be able to do the head of
hair on it, in the very hair itself of that sovereign. One or two of such
wrought likenesses of king Charles were, not long ago, shown in the
exhibition of miniatures which took place in this Museum.</p>

<p>For verifying passages in early as well as mediæval times, little does
the historian think of finding in these specimens such a help for the
purpose.</p>

<p>Quintus Curtius tells us, that, reaching India, the Greeks under
Alexander found there a famous breed of dogs for lion-hunting more
especially. On beholding a wild beast they hush their yelpings, and
hold their prey by the teeth with so much stubbornness that sooner than
let go their bite they would suffer one of their own limbs to be cut off:
“Nobiles ad venandum canes in ea regione sunt: latratu abstinere
dicuntur, quum viderunt feram, leonibus maxime, infesti,” &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> Such
is the animal now known as the cheetah, which, as of old so all through
the middle ages, up to the present time, has been trained everywhere in
Persia and over India for hunting purposes; and called by our countryman,
Sir John Mandeville, a “papyonn,” as we have noticed in this
catalogue, p. <a href="#Page_178">178</a>. This far-famed hunting-dog of Quintus Curtius,
now known as the cheetah or hunting-lion, may be often met with on
silken textiles here from Asiatic looms, especially in Nos. <a href="#h-7083">7083</a>, p. 136;

For</span> a sight of some liturgical appliances which, though once
so common and everywhere employed have become rare
from having one by one dropped into disuse, ritualists,
foreign ones among the rest, will have to come hither. A
few more of such articles, though still in common use, are remarkable
for the antiquity or the costliness of those stuffs out of which they
happen to be made.</p>

<p>For its age, and the beauty of its needlework, the Syon cope is in
itself a remarkable treasure, while its emblazoned orphreys, like the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_cxxiv">[Pg cxxiv]</span>
vestments on the person of a Percy in Beverley minster, make it, at least
according to present custom, singular. Several chasubles here so noteworthy
for their gorgeousness, have their fellows equal in splendour, elsewhere;
but in this museum are a few articles which till now we might
have sought for in vain throughout Christendom in any other private or
public collection.</p>

<p>Such liturgical boxes as those two&mdash;No. <a href="#h-5958">5958</a>, p. 112, and No.
<a href="#h-8327">8327</a>, p. 193&mdash;are of the kind known of old as the “capsella cum serico
decenter ornata”&mdash;a little box beseemingly fitted up with silk&mdash;of the
mediæval writers; or the “capsula corporalium”&mdash;the box in which are
kept the corporals or square pieces of fine linen, a fine mediæval specimen
of which is here, <a href="#h-8329">No. 8329</a>, p. 195, of the rubrics which, to this
day, require its employment for a particular service, during holy week.
Like its use the name of this appliance is very old, and both are spoken of
in those ancient “Ordines Romani,” in the first of which, drawn up now
more than a thousand years ago, it is directed: “tunc duo acolythi tenentes
capsas cum Sanctis apertas, &amp;c.;”<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> and again, in another “Ordo,”
written out some little time before <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1143, a part of the rubric for
Good Friday requires the Pope to go barefoot during the procession in
which a cardinal carries the Host consecrated the day before, and
preserved in the corporals’ chest or box: “discalceatus (papa) pergit
cum processione.... Quidam cardinalis honorifice portat corpus
Domini præteriti diei conservatum, in capsula corporalium.”<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> About
the mass of the presanctified, before the beginning of which this procession
took as it yet takes place, we have said a few words at pp. <a href="#Page_112">112</a>, <a href="#Page_113">113</a>.
What is meant by the word “corporal,” we have explained, p. <a href="#Page_194">194</a>.
Here in England, such small wooden boxes covered with silks and velvets
richly embroidered, were once employed for the same liturgical uses.
The Exeter inventories specify them thus: “unum repositorium ligneum
pro corporalibus co-opertum cum saccis de serico;”<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> “tria corporalia
in casa lignea co-operta cum panno serico, operata cum diversis
armis.”<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a></p>

<p>Good Friday brings to mind a religious practice followed wherever the
Greek ritual is observed, and the appliance for which, <a href="#h-8278">No. 8278</a>, p. 170,
we have there spoken of at such length as to save us here any further
notice of this interesting kind of frontal, upon which is shown our dead
Lord lying stretched out upon the sindon or winding-sheet. Of the
Cyrillian character in which the Greek sentences upon it are written, we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_cxxv">[Pg cxxv]</span>
shall have a more fitting opportunity for speaking a little further on. At
Rome, in the Pope’s chapel, the frontal set before the altar for the function
of Maundy Thursday, is of gold cloth figured, amid other subjects
suitable to the time, with our Lord lying dead between two angels who
are upholding His head, as we learn from the industrious Cancellieri’s
description, in his “Settimana Santa nella cappella pontificia.”<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></p>

<p>In Greece may be still found several churches built with a dome, all
around which is figured, in painting or in mosaics, what is there known
as and called the “Divine Liturgy,” after this manner. On the eastern
side, and before an altar, but facing the west, stands our Lord, robed as
a patriarch, about to offer up the mass. The rest of the round in the
cupola is filled with a crowd of angels,&mdash;some arrayed in chasubles like
priests, some as deacons, but each bearing in his hands either one of the
several vestments or some liturgical vessel or appliance needed at the
celebration of the sacred mysteries,&mdash;all walking, as it were, to the
spot where stands the divine pontiff. But amid this angel-throng may
be seen six of these winged ministers who are carrying between them a
sindon exactly figured as is the one of which we are now speaking. How,
according to the Greek ritual, this subject ought to be done, is given in
the Painter’s Guide, edited by Didron.<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> Though of yore as now a
somewhat similar ceremonial was always observed according to the
Latin rite, in carrying his vestments to a bishop when he pontificated,
never in such a procession here, in the west, was any frontal or sindon
borne, as in the east.</p>

<p>With regard to “red” as the mourning colour, in the sindon, our own
old English use joined it with “black” upon vestments especially intended
to be worn in services for the dead. For especial use on Good Friday
Bishop Grandison gave to his cathedral (Exeter) a black silk chasuble, the
red orphrey at the back of which had embroidered on it our Lord hanging
upon a green cross: “j casula de nigro serico, pro Die Paraschive,
cum j orfrey quasi rubii coloris, cum crucifixo pendente in viridi cruce,
ex dono Johannis Grandissono;”<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> and in the same document, among the
black copes and chasubles, we find that they had their orphreys made of
red: “cape nigre cum casulis&mdash;j casula de nigro velvete cum rubeo
velvete in le orfrey. ij tuniculi ejusdem panni et secte. iij cape ejusdem
panni et secte.”<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></p>

<p>At Lincoln cathedral there were “a chesable of black cloth of gold of
bawdkin with a red orphrey, &amp;c.; a black cope of cloth of silver with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_cxxvi">[Pg cxxvi]</span>
an orphrey of red velvet broidered with flowers, &amp;c.; a black cope of
camlet broidered with flowers of woodbine with an orphrey of red cloth
of gold,” &amp;c.; two copes of black satin with orphreys of red damask,
broidered with flowers of gold, having, in the back, souls rising to their
doom, &amp;c., besides other vestments of the same kind.<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> Green, sometimes
along with red, sometimes taking the latter’s place in the orphreys,
may be seen on some of our old vestments.</p>

<p>Those two pyx-cloths at <a href="#h-8342">No. 8342</a>, p. 202, and <a href="#h-8691">No. 8691</a>, p. 260,
will have an interest for the student of mediæval liturgy as we have
already pointed out, p. <a href="#Page_202">202</a>. While in Italy the custom, during the
middle ages at least, never prevailed, here in England as well as all over
France, and several countries on the Continent, it did, of keeping the
Eucharist under one form, hung up over the high altar beneath a beautiful
canopy within a pyx of gold, silver, ivory, or enamel, and mantled with a
fine linen embroidered cloth or veil. At present this “velum pyidis”
overspreading the ciborium or pyx in the tabernacle, is of silk.</p>

<p>In olden days the veil for the pyx was, here in England, beautifully
embroidered with golden thread and coloured silks, and usually carried
three crowns of gold or silver, as is shown in the woodcut, “Church of
our Fathers,”<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> and often mentioned in many of our national documents
which, without some such notice as this, could not be rightly understood.
Among the things once belonging to Richard II. in Haverford castle and
sent by the sheriff of Hereford to the exchequer, at the beginning of
Henry IV.’s reign, are three crowns of gold, a gold cup, and one of
the pyx-veils like these: “iij corones d’or pour le Corps Ihu Cryst.
i coupe d’or pour le Corps Ihu Cryst. i towayll ove (avec) i longe
parure de mesure la suyte.”<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a></p>

<p>By different people, and at various periods, a variety of names was
given to this fine linen covering. Describing in his will, one made in
this country and so valuable for its English needlework, a bishop of
Tournay (see before p. <a href="#Page_xcix">xcix</a>) calls it a corporal: in the inventory of
things taken from Dr. Caius, and in the college of his own founding at
Cambridge, are: “corporas clothes, with the pix and ‘sindon’ and
canopie,” &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> This variety in nomenclature doubtless led writers
unacquainted with ritual matters to state that before Mary Queen of
Scots bent her head upon the block, she had a “corporal,” properly so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_cxxvii">[Pg cxxvii]</span>
called, bound over her eyes. What to our seeming this bandage really
was, must have been a large piece of fine linen embroidered by her own
hands&mdash;Mary wrought much with her needle, as specimens of her doing
yet remain at Chatsworth, and at Greystock show&mdash;meant for, perhaps
too once used as a pyx-cloth, and not an altar corporal.</p>

<p>Whilst these pages were going through the press, one of these old
English pyx, or Corpus Christi cloths, was found at the bottom of a
chest in Hessett church, Suffolk. As it is a remarkable and unique specimen
of the ingenious handicraft done by our mediæval countrywomen,
we notice it. To make this pyx-cloth, a piece of thick linen, about
two feet square, was chosen, and being marked off into small equal widths
on all its four edges, the threads at every other space were, both in the
warp and woof, pulled out. The checquers or squares so produced all
over it were then drawn in by threads tied on the under side, so as to
have the shape of stars, so well and nicely given that, till this piece had
been narrowly looked into, it was thought to be guipure lace. Of a
textile so admirably wrought, it is to be regretted that there is, as yet,
no sample in this collection. This curious liturgical appliance is figured
in the April number, for the year 1868, of the “Ecclesiologist,”
page 86.</p>

<p>For the several very curious sorts of ornamental needlework about it,
and the somewhat intricate manner after which it is cut out, the old alb,
No. <a href="#h-8710">8710</a>, p. 268, as well as the amice, <a href="#h-8307">No. 8307</a>, p. 185, having both
of them the apparels yet remaining sewed on to these church garments,
must draw the attention of every inquirer after such rare existing samples
of the kind.</p>

<p>Some very fine threaden cloths&mdash;now become rare&mdash;for liturgical purposes,
deserve attention. In the old inventories of church furniture in
England, they are known under the name of “filatoria,” about which
we have spoken just now, p. <a href="#Page_cix">cix</a>. At No. <a href="#h-4457">4457</a>, p. 99, is a towel which,
it is likely, was spread under the tapers for Candlemass-day, and the
twigs of the sallow, or willow (our so-called palm), and slips of the box-tree,
for Palm-Sunday, while they were being hallowed before distribution.
For several lectern veils, we shall have to go to <a href="#h-7029">No. 7029</a>, p. 120;

<p>Those two linen napkins, formerly kept hanging down from just below
the crook on a pastoral staff or crozier are become so excessively rare,
that we unhesitatingly believe that none of our countrymen have ever
been able to find, either in England or abroad, a single other sample;
they are to be seen, No. <a href="#h-8279a">8279<span class="allsmcap">A</span></a>, p. 174, and <a href="#h-8662">No. 8662</a>, p. 250.</p>

<p>Those who have ever witnessed on a Sunday morning in any of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_cxxviii">[Pg cxxviii]</span>
great churches at Paris, the blessing of the French “pain beni”&mdash;our
old English “holy loaf”&mdash;the “eulogia” of antiquity&mdash;will call to mind
how a fair white linen cloth, like the one here, <a href="#h-8698">No. 8698</a>, p. 263,
overspread, and fell in graceful folds down from two sides of the board
upon which, borne on the shoulders of four youthful acolytes, a large
round cake garnished with flowers and wax-tapers was carried through
the chancel, and halting at the altar’s foot got its blessing from the
celebrant.</p>

<p>The rich crimson velvet cope, <a href="#h-79">No. 79</a>, p. 2, has a fine hood figured
with the coming down, after the usual manner, of the Holy Ghost upon
the infant church. <a href="#h-8595">No. 8595</a>, p. 226, presents us with a shred merely of
what must have been once a large hanging for the chancel walls, or perhaps
one of the two curtains at the altar’s sides, having such fragments
of some Latin sentences as these:&mdash;“et tui amoris in eis ... tus.
Re ... le tuoru.” The subject on the cope’s hood tells of Pentecost
Sunday; so too does the second article, for those broken sentences
are parts of particular words: “Veni Sancte Spiritus, reple tuorum
corda fidelium: et tui amoris in eis ignem accende,” to be found both in
our own old English Salisbury missal, and breviary, but in every like
service-book in use during the mediæval period throughout western
Christendom. Be it kept in mind that both these liturgical appliances are
red or crimson; and as now, so heretofore, as well in old England, as
elsewhere this very colour has been employed for the church’s vestments,
thus to remind us of those parted tongues, as it were, of fire
that sat upon every one of the Apostles.<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> We mention all this with a
view to correct an error in lexicography. In our dictionaries we are told
that “Whitsuntide” is a contracted form of White Sunday tide, so called
from the white vestments worn on that day by the candidates for baptism.
Nothing of the sort; but the word “wits,” our intellect or
understanding, is the root of the term, for a curious and valuable old
English book of sermons called “The Festival,” tells us:&mdash;“This day
is called Wytsonday by cause the Holy Ghoost brought wytte and wysdom
in to Cristis dyscyples; and so by her preachyng after in to all
Cristendom.”<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a></p>

<p>Somewhat akin to this subject, are those several christening cloaks
here, pp. <a href="#Page_8">8</a>, <a href="#Page_9">9</a>, <a href="#Page_10">10</a>, <a href="#Page_11">11</a>. Not long ago the custom was to carry to church
for baptism the baby wrapped up in some such a silken covering which
was called a bearing-cloth. Of old, that used to be a conspicuous article
in all royal christenings; and amongst our gentry was looked upon as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_cxxix">[Pg cxxix]</span>
worthy enough of being made a testamentary bequest. At the christening
of Arthur Prince of Wales, eldest son of Henry VII. “my Lady
Cecill, the Queen’s eldest sister, bare the prince wrapped in a Mantell
of Cremesyn Clothe of Golde furred with Ermyn,” &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> Such ceremonial
garments varied, according to the owner’s position of life, in
costliness; hence Shakespeare makes the shepherd, in the “Winter’s
Tale,” cry out, “Here’s a sight for thee; look thee, a bearing cloth for
a squire’s child!”<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> A well-to-do tradesman bequeathed, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1648, to
his daughter Rose his “beareing cloath such ... linnen as is belonginge
to infants at their tyme of baptisme.”<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a></p>

<p>Very often in our old country houses are found, thrown aside in some
antique chest, certain small square pieces of nice embroidery, the former
use for which nobody now knows, and about which one is asked. If
their owners would look at those several cradle-quilts here&mdash;pp. <a href="#Page_4">4</a>, <a href="#Page_13">13</a>,
<a href="#Page_66">66</a>, <a href="#Page_67">67</a>, <a href="#Page_100">100</a>, <a href="#Page_103">103</a>, <a href="#Page_104">104</a>, <a href="#Page_110">110</a>&mdash;they might find out such ancient household
stuff was wrought for their forefathers’ comfort and adornment, when
mere babies. The evangelists’ emblems figured on several among these
coverlets: such as <a href="#h-1344">No. 1344</a>, p. 67, <a href="#h-4459">No. 4459</a>, p. 100, <a href="#h-4644">No. 4644</a>, p.
103, will call to mind those old nursery-rhymes we referred to at p. <a href="#Page_103">103</a>.
Of yore, not only little children, but grown-up, ay, aged men too loved to
think about those verses, when they went to sleep, for the inventory of
furniture taken, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1446, in the Priory of Durham, tells us that in the
upper chamber there was a bed-quilt embroidered with the four Evangelists&mdash;one
in each corner: “j culcitrum cum iiij or Evangelistis in
corneriis.”<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a></p>

<p>The bag or purse, <a href="#h-8313">No. 8313</a>, p. 188, is of a kind which not only were
used for those liturgical purposes which we have already enumerated, but
served for private devotional practices. In that very interesting will made
by Henry, Lord de Scrope, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1415, among other pious bequests, is
the following one, of the little bag having in it a piece of our Lord’s cross,
which he always wore about his neck;&mdash;“j bursa parva quæ semper
pendet circa collum meum cum cruce Domini.”<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a></p>

<p>The crimson velvet mitre,&mdash;No. <a href="#h-4015">4015</a>, p. 85,&mdash;for the boy-bishop,
bairn-bishop, or Nicholas-tide bishop, as the little boy was severally
called in England, is a liturgical curiosity, as the ceremonies in which it
was formerly worn are everywhere laid aside. Among the things given
for the use of the chapel in the college&mdash;All Souls&mdash;of his founding at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_cxxx">[Pg cxxx]</span>
Oxford by Archbishop Chicheley, are a cope and mitre for this boy,
there named the Nicholas-tide bishope:&mdash;“i cap. et mitre pro episcopo
Nicholao.”<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> To make good his election to such a dignity, at Eton
College, a boy had to study hard and show at the examination for it,
that he was the ablest there at his books: his success almost ennobled
him among his schoolfellows:&mdash;“In die Sti Hugonis pontificis” (17 Nov.)
“solebat Ætonæ fieri electio Episcopi Nihilensis, sed consuetudo obsolevit.
Olim episcopus ille puerorum habebatur nobilis, in cujus electione, et
literata et laudatissima exercitatio, ad ingeniorum vires et motos exercendos,
Ætonæ celebris erat.”<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> The colour, crimson, in this boy’s mitre,
was to distinguish it from that of bishops.</p>

<p>Of the episcopal bairn-cloth&mdash;the Gremiale of foreign liturgists&mdash;we
have two specimens here,&mdash;Nos. <a href="#h-1031">1031</a>, <a href="#h-1032">1032</a>, pp. 19, 20. The rich
one of crimson cloth of gold, once belonging to Bowet, Archbishop of
York, who died <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1423, brought more money than even a chasuble
of the same stuff:&mdash;“Et de xxvj<i>s.</i> viij<i>d.</i> receptis pro j. bairnecloth de
rubeo panno auri. Et de xx<i>s.</i> receptis pro j casula de rubeo beaudkyn,
&amp;c. Inventorium,” &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a></p>

<p>Old episcopal shoes are now become great liturgical rarities, but there
is one here,&mdash;No. <a href="#h-1290">1290</a>, p. 46. At one time they were called
“sandals;” and among the episcopal ornaments that went by usage to
Durham cathedral at the death of any of its bishops, were “mitra et
baculum et sandalia et cætera episcopalia,” of Hugh Pudsey, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1195.<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a>
Later was given them the name of “sabatines;” and Archbishop Bowet’s
inventory mentions two pairs:&mdash;“pro j pare de sabbatones, brouddird, et
couch’ cum perell’; pro j pare de sabbatones de albo panno auri,” &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a></p>

Will</span>, on many occasions, heartily rejoice to have, within
easy reach, such an extensive, varied, and curious collection
of textiles gathered from many lands, and wrought in
different ages.</p>

<p>For the painter and the decorator it must have a peculiar value.</p>

<p>Until this collection of silken and other kinds of woven stuffs had been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_cxxxi">[Pg cxxxi]</span>
brought to England, and opened for the world’s inspection and study, an
artist had not, either in this country or abroad, any available means of
being correctly true in the patterns of those silks and velvets with which
he wished to array his personages, or of the hangings for garnishing the
walls of the hall in which he laid the scene of his subject. In such a
need, right glad was he if he might go to any small collection of scanty
odds and ends belonging to a friend, or kept in private hands. So keenly
was this want felt, that, but a few years ago, works of beautiful execution,
but of costly price, were undertaken upon the dress of olden times,
and mediæval furniture; yet those who got up such books could do
nothing better than set out in drawings, as their authorities for both the
branches of their subject, such few specimens as they could pick up
figured in illuminated MSS. and the works of the early masters. Here,
however, our own and foreign artists see before them, not copies, but
those very self-same stuffs.</p>

<p>If we go to our National Gallery and look at the mediæval pictures
there, taking note of the stuffs in which those old men who did them
clothed their personages; if, then, we step hither, we shall be struck by
the fact of seeing in these very textiles, duplicates, as far as pattern is
sought, of those same painted garments. For example, in Orcagna’s
Coronation of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the blue silk diapered in gold,
with flowers and birds, hung as a back ground; our Lord’s white tunic
diapered in gold with foliage; the mantle of His mother made of the
same stuff; St. Stephen’s dalmatic of green samit, diapered with golden
foliage, are all quite Sicilian in design, and copied from those rich silks
which came, at the middle of the fourteenth century, from the looms of
Palermo. While standing before Jacopo di Casentino’s St. John, our
eye is drawn, on the instant, to the orphrey on that evangelist’s chasuble,
embroidered, after the Tuscan style, with barbed quatrefoils, shutting in
the busts of Apostles. Isotta da Rimini, in her portrait by Pietro della
Francesca, wears a gown made of velvet and gold, much like some cut
velvets here.</p>

<p>In the patterns followed by the Sicilian looms, and those of Italy in
general, may almost always be found the same especial elements. Of
these, one is the artichoke in flower; and in F. Francia’s painting of the
Blessed Virgin Mary with our Lord in her arms, and saints standing about
them,&mdash;No. 179,&mdash;St. Laurence’s rich cloth of gold is diapered all over
with the artichoke marked out in thin red lines. So, too, in the picture
of V. Cappaccio, <a href="#h-750">No. 750</a>, the cloth-of-gold mantle worn by our Lord’s
mother, as well as the dress of the Doge, are both diapered with this
favourite Italian vegetable. Often is this artichoke shut in by an oval,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_cxxxii">[Pg cxxxii]</span>
made sometimes of ogee arches, with their finials shooting forwards outside:
thus is diapered the cloak of the Madonna, in Crivelli’s Inthronement&mdash;No.
724. Much more frequently, however, this oval is put
together out of architectural cusps&mdash;six or eight&mdash;turned inside, and
their featherings sprouting out into a trefoil, as in our own Early English
style. Such ovals round an artichoke are well shown in each of the
four pictures by Melozzo da Forli, on the pede-cloth with which the
steps in each of them are covered. Of such a patterned stuff here
we select from several such, for the reader, Nos. <a href="#h-1352">1352</a>, p. 70; <a href="#h-1352">1352<span class="allsmcap">A</span></a>,
p. 70.</p>

<p>Stained and patterned papers for wall-hanging are even yet unknown
but in a very few places on the Continent. The employment of them
as furniture among ourselves is comparatively very modern, and came to
England, it is likely, through our trade with China. Though in Italy
the state apartment and the reception rooms of a palace are hung always
with rich damasks, and often with fine tapestry, while some old examples
of gilt and beautifully-wrought leather trailed all over with coloured
flowers and leaves are still to be found, the rooms for domestic use
have their whitewashed walls adorned at best with a coloured ornamentation,
bestowed upon them by the cheap and ready process of stencilling.</p>

<p>From early times up to the middle of the sixteenth century, our
cathedrals and parish churches, our castles, manorial houses, and granges,
the dwellings of the wealthy everywhere, used to be ornamented with
wall-painting done, not in “fresco,” but in “secco;” that is, distemper.
Upon high festivals the walls of the churches were overspread with
tapestry and needlework; so, too, those in the halls of the gentry, for
some solemn ceremonial.</p>

<p>Our high-born ladies used to spend their leisure hours in working
these “hallings,” as they were called; and while Bradshaw, a monk of
St. Werburgh’s monastery at Chester, sings the praises of the patron-saint
of his church, he gives us a charming picture of how a large hall
was arrayed here in England with needlework, for a solemn feast some
time about the latter end of the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>First of all, according to the then wont, when great folks were bidden
to a feast:&mdash;</p>

<p>The tapestries here will afford much help to the artist if he have to
paint a dining room with festive doings going on, any time during the
latter portion of the mediæval period; but such “hallings” are by no
means scarce. Not so, however, such pieces of room hangings as he
may find here at <a href="#h-1370">No. 1370</a>, p. 76; <a href="#h-1297">No. 1297</a>, p. 296; No. <a href="#h-1465">1465</a>

<p>At a certain period, gloves were a much more ornamented and
decorative article of dress than now; and, when meant for ladies’ wear,
a somewhat lasting perfume was bestowed upon them. Among the new
year’s day presents to Tudor Queen Mary, some years before she came to
the throne, was “a payr of gloves embrawret with gold.”<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> A year afterwards,
“x payr of Spanyneshe gloves from a Duches in Spayne,” came to
her;<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> and but a month before, Mrs. Whellers had sent to her highness
“a pair of swete gloves.” Shakespeare, true to manners of his days, after
making the pretended pedler, Autolycus, thus chant the praises of his&mdash;</p>

hung about them, be all gone, yet their shape and embroideries will
render them a valuable item to the artist for some painting.</p>

<p>Manufacturers and master-weavers of every kind of textile, as well as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_cxxxiv">[Pg cxxxiv]</span>
their workmen, may gather some useful hints for their trade, by a look at
the various specimens set out here before them.</p>

<p>They will, no doubt, congratulate themselves, as they fairly may,
that their better knowledge of chemistry enables them to give to silk,
wool, and cotton, tints and tones of tints, and shades, nay, entire colours
quite unknown to the olden times, even to their elders of a few years
ago: our new-found chemicals are carrying the dyeing art to a high
point of beauty and perfection.</p>

<p>Among the several boasts of the present age one is, that of making
machinery, as a working power in delicate operations, so true, as if it had
been quickened with a life and will and power all its own: mechanism
applied to weaving is, at least for the speed of plain work, most marvellous;
and the improvements of the morrow over those of yesterday
make the wonder grow. But, though having such appliances at hand,
let an able well-taught designer for silken stuffs come hither, along with
a skilled weaver, from Coventry, Glasgow, or Manchester, and the two
will say, that for truthfulness and beauty in the drawing of the patterns,
and their good renderings in the weaving, nothing of the present day is
better, while much is often not so good. Yet these old stuffs before our
eyes were wrought in looms so clumsy, and awkward, and helpless, that
a weaver of the present day laughs at them in scorn. The man, however,
who should happen to be asked to make the working drawings for
several of such textiles, would fain acknowledge that he had been taught
much by their study, and must strive hard before he might surpass many
of them in the often crowded, yet generally clear combination of parts
borrowed from beasts, birds, and flowers, all rendered with beauty and
fittingness.</p>

<p>What has been, may be done again. We know better how to dye;
we have more handy mechanism. Let, then, all those who belong any-wise
to the weaving trade and come hither, go home resolved to stand for
the future behind no nation, either of past or present time, in the ability
of weaving not only useful, but beautiful and artistic textiles.</p>

<p>Before leaving the South Kensington Museum the master weaver
may, if he wishes, convince himself that the so-called tricks of the trade
are not evils of this age’s growth, but, it is likely, older than history
herself. For mediæval instances of fraud in his own line of business,
he will find not a few among the silks from Syria, Palermo, and the
South of Spain.</p>

<p>What we said just now about Lettered Silks, p. <a href="#Page_lix">lix</a>. should be borne
here in mind. With the Saracens, wherever they spread themselves,
the usage was to weave upon their textiles, very often, either the title of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_cxxxv">[Pg cxxxv]</span>
the prince who was to wear them or give them away, or some short
form of prayer or benediction. By Christian eyes, such Arabic words
were looked upon as the true unerring sign that the stuffs that showed
them came from Saracenic looms&mdash;the best of those times&mdash;or, in other
terms, were the trade-mark of the Moslem. The Christian and Jewish
weavers in many parts of the East, to make their own webs pass as
Saracenic goods, wrought the Paynim trade-mark, as then understood,
upon them. The forgery is clumsy: the letters are poor imitations of
the Arabic character, and the pretended word runs, as it should, first
correctly, or from right to left, then wrong or backward from left to
right, just as if this part of the pattern&mdash;and it is nothing more&mdash;had
been intended, like every other element in it, to confront itself by immediate
repetition on the self-same line. Our young folks who sometimes
amuse themselves by writing a name on paper, and while the ink is wet
fold the sheet so that the word is shown again as if written backwards,
get such a kind of scroll.</p>

<p>In many Oriental silk textiles the warp is either of hemp, flax, or
cotton; but this is so easily discoverable that it could hardly have been
done for fraud’ sake. There is however a Saracenic trick, learned from
that people, and afterwards practised by the Spaniards of the South, for
imitating a woof of gold. It is rather ingenious, and we presume
unknown among collectors and writers until now.</p>

<p>For the purpose, the finer sort of parchment was sought out, sometimes
as thin as that now rare kind of vellum called, among manuscript
collectors, “uterine.” Such skins were well gilt and then cut into very
narrow shreds, which were afterwards, instead of gold, woven, as the
woof to the silken warp, to show those portions of the pattern which
should be wrought in golden thread. But as these strips of gilded
parchment were flat, they necessarily gave the stuffs in which they came
all the look of being that costly and much used web called by us in the
fifteenth century “tyssewys,” as we have before noticed, p. <a href="#Page_xxxi">xxxi</a>.
Specimens of such a fraudulent textile are to be seen here, Nos. <a href="#h-7067">7067</a>,

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">
A</span> metaphor or figurative speech is the utterance to the
understanding through the ear of words which have other
and further meanings in them than their first one. Symbolism
is the bringing to our thoughts, through the eye,
some natural object, some human personage, some art-wrought figure,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_cxxxvi">[Pg cxxxvi]</span>
which is meant to set forth a some one, or a something else besides
itself.</p>

<p>The use of both arose among men when they first began to dwell on
earth and live together. Through symbolism, and the phonetic system,
Egypt struck out for herself her three alphabets&mdash;the hieroglyphic or
picture writing; the hieratic or priestly characters, or shortened form of
the hieroglyphics; and the enchorial or people’s alphabet, a further
abridgment still. The Hebrew letters are the conventional symbols of
things in nature or art; and even yet, each keeps the name of the object
which at first it represented; as “aleph” or “ox,” “beth” or “house,”
“gimel” or “camel,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>Holy Writ is full of symbolism; and from the moment that we begin
to read those words&mdash;“I will set my bow in the clouds, and it shall be
the sign of a covenant,”<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> till we reach the last chapter in the New
Testament, we shall, all throughout, come upon many most beautiful
and appropriate examples. The blood sprinkled upon the door-posts of
the Israelites; the brazen serpent in the wilderness; that sign&mdash;that
mystic and saving sign (Tau) of Ezekiel, were, each and every one of
them symbols.</p>

<div class="footnote">

</div>

<p>Being given to understand that things which happened to the Jews
were so many symbols for us, the early Christian Church figured on the
walls of the catacombs many passages from ancient Jewish history as
applicable to itself, while its writers bestowed much attention on the
study of symbolism. S. Melito, bishop of Sardes, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 170, drew out of
scripture a great many texts which would bear a symbolical meaning, and
gave to his work the name of “The Key.” Almost quite forgotten,
and well nigh lost, this valuable book, after long and unwearied labour,
was at last found and printed by Dom (now Cardinal) Pitra in his
Spicilegium Solesmense, t. ii. Among other works from the pen of St.
Epiphanius, born <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 310, we have his annotations on a book, then
old, and called “The Physiologist,” and a work of his own&mdash;a treatise
on the twelve stones worn by Aaron,<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> in both of which, the Saint speaks
much about symbolism. But the fourth century witnessed the production
of the two great works on Scriptural Symbolism; that of St.
Basil in his homilies on the six days’ creation;<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> which sermons in
Greek were styled by their writer “Hexæmeron;” and the other by
St. Ambrose, in Latin, longer and more elaborated, on the same subject
and bearing the same title. A love for such a study grew up with the
church’s growth everywhere, from the far east to the utmost west, amid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_cxxxvii">[Pg cxxxvii]</span>
Greeks as well as Latins, all of whom beheld, in their several liturgies,
many illustrations of the system. It was not confined to clerics, but
laymen warmly followed it. The artist, whether he had to set forth his
work in painting or mosaic; the architects, whether they were entrusted
with the raising of a church, or building a royal palace, nay a dwelling-house,
were, each of them, but too glad to avail themselves, under
clerical guidance, of such a powerful help for beautiful variety and happy
illustration as was afforded them by Christian Symbolism. So systematized
at last became this subject that by the eleventh century we find it
separated into three branches&mdash;beasts, birds, and stones&mdash;and works were
written upon each. Those upon beasts were, as they still are, known by
the title of “Bestiaria,” or books on beasts; “Volucraria,” on birds,
and “Lapideria,” on stones. About the same period, as an offset from
symbolism, heraldry sprang up; whether the crusaders were the first to
bethink themselves of such a method for personal recognition and distinction;
or whether they borrowed the idea from the peoples in the
east, and while adopting, much improved upon it, matters not; heraldry
grew out of symbolism. Very soon it was made to tell about secular as
well as sacred things; and poets, nay political partizans were quick in
their learning of its language. The weaver too of silken webs was often
bade, while gearing his loom, to be directed by its teaching, as several
specimens in this collection will testify. That some of the patterns,
made up of beasts and birds, upon silken stuffs from Sicilian, or Italian
looms and here before us, were sketched by a partizan pencil and
advisedly meant to carry about them an historic, if not political signification,
we do not for a moment doubt. Several instances of sacred
symbolism here, have been specified, and some explanation of it given.</p>

<p>The “gammadion,” or the cross made thus <big>卐</big> a figure which, as
we said before, is to be seen traced upon the earliest heathenish art-works,
as well as the latest mediæval ones for Christian use, may be often found
wrought on textiles here.</p>

<p>Knowing, as we do, that the first time this symbol shows itself to our
eyes, is in the pattern figured on a web of the Pharaonic period, it is to
the early history of Egypt we ought to go, if we wish to learn its origin
and meaning.</p>

<p>The most astounding event of the world’s annals was the going out
of Israel from Egypt. The blood of the lamb slain and sacrificed the
evening before, and put upon both the door-posts, as well as sprinkled at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_cxxxviii">[Pg cxxxviii]</span>
the threshold of the house wherein any Hebrew dwelt&mdash;a sign of safety
from all harm and death to man and beast, within its walls, on that
awful night when throughout all Egypt the first-born of everything else
was killed&mdash;must have caught the sight of every wonder-stricken Egyptian
father and mother who, while weeping over their loss, heard that death
had not gone in to do the work of slaughter where the blood had signed
the gates of every Israelite.</p>

<p>Among the Hebrew traditions, handed down to us by the Rabbins,
one is that the mark made by the Israelites upon their door-posts with
the blood of the sacrificed lamb, the night before starting out of Egypt,
was fashioned like the letter Tau made after its olden form, that is, in
the shape of a cross, thus +.</p>

<p>What is still more curious, we are told that the lamb itself was spitted
as if it had been meant to bear about its body, an unmistakable likeness
to a kind of crucifixion. Treating of the passover, the Talmud says:&mdash;The
ram or kid was roasted in an oven whole, with two spits made of
pomegranate wood thrust through it, the one lengthwise, the other
transversely (crossing the longitudinal one near the fore-legs) thus forming
a cross.<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> Precisely the same thing is said by St. Justin, martyr, born
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 103, in his Dialogue with Tryphon the Jew. This very mode of
roasting is expressed in Arabic by the verb “to crucify;” according to
Jahn, in his “Biblical Antiquities,” § 142, as quoted by Kitto, under
the word Passover.<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a></p>

</div>

<p>From the words of St. Jerome, it would seem that that learned hebraist,
well knowing, as he did, the traditions of the rabbins of his day, had
understood from them that the mark of the lamb’s blood sprinkled on the
doors of the Israelites going out of Egypt, had been so made as to take
the shape of a cross.</p>

<p>Deeply smitten as the whole of Egypt must have been at the woe that
befel them and theirs, the night before the great exode of the Israelites
from among them, those Egyptians could not help seeing how all the
Hebrews, their children, and their flocks had gone forth scatheless out of
that death-stricken land. At peep of dawn, the blood upon the door-posts
of every house where an Israelite had lately dwelt, told the secret;
for the destroyer had not been there. From that hour, a Tau was
thought by them to be the symbol of health and safety, of happiness, and
future life. St. Epiphanius, born <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 310, in Palestine, for many years
Archbishop of Salamis in Cyprus, and a great traveller in Egypt, tells us,
that being mindful of that day on which the Israelites who had besmeared
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_cxxxix">[Pg cxxxix]</span>
the door-posts of their houses with the blood of the lamb, had been
spared the angel’s death-stroke, the Egyptian people were accustomed, at
every vernal equinox&mdash;their new year&mdash;to daub, with red paint, their
doors, their trees, and animals, the while they cried out that, “once
at this time fire blighted every thing;” against such a plague, they think
that the remedy is a spell in the colour of blood: “Egyptios memores
illius diei quo a cæde angeli liberati sunt Israelitæ qui agni sanguine postes
domorum illinierant, solitos esse, intrante æquinoctio vernanti, accipere
rubricam et illinere omnes arbores domosque clamantes ‘quia in tempore
hoc ignis vastavit omnia’ contra quam luem remedium putant ignis colorem
sanguineum rubricæ.”<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_414" href="#FNanchor_414" class="label">[414]</a> Hæreses, xviii.</p>

</div>

<p>While they found blood upon the departed and unharmed Israelites’
door-posts, the sorrowing Egyptians must have seen that it had been
sprinkled there, not at hazard, but with the studied purpose of making
therewith the Egyptian letter Tau, as it used to be fashioned at the
time. But what was then its common shape? That the old Tau was
a cross, we are told by written authority, and learn from monumental
evidence. Learned as he was in all the wisdom of the Egyptians,
Moses, no doubt, wrote with the letters of their alphabet. Now, the
oldest shape of the Tau in the Hebrew alphabet, and still kept up among
the Samaritans in St. Jerome’s days, was in the form of a cross: “Antiquis
Hebræorum literis, quibus usque hodie Samaritæ utuntur, extrema
Tau crucis habet similitudinem, quæ in Christianorum frontibus pingitur
et frequentius manus inscriptione signatur.”<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> For monumental testimony
we refer the reader to the proofs we have given, at large, in “Hierurgia,”
pp. 352-355, second edition. Strengthening our idea that the lamb’s
blood had been put on the door-post in the shape of a cross, and that
hence the old Egyptians had borrowed it as a spell against evil hap, and a
symbol of a life hereafter, is a passage set forth, first by Rufinus, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>
397, and then by Socrates, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 440:&mdash;“On demolishing at Alexandria
a temple dedicated to Serapis, were observed several stones sculptured
with letters called hieroglyphics, which showed the figure of a cross.
Certain Gentile inhabitants of the city who had lately been converted to
the Christian faith, initiated in the method of interpreting these enigmatic
characters, declared that the figure of the cross was considered as the
symbol of future life.”<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> We know that, while the old Tau kept the
shape of a cross, it took at least three modifications of that form on those
monuments which, up to this time, have been brought to light: others
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_cxl">[Pg cxl]</span>
may turn up with that letter traced exactly like the so-called “gammadion”
found upon an Egyptian stuff of such an early date. Most probably
this was the very shape, but with shorter arms, of the letter found
traced upon the door-posts.</p>

</div>

<p>The recurrence of the gammadion upon Christian monuments is curious.
We find it shown upon the tunic of a gravedigger in the catacombs;
it comes in among the ornamentation wrought upon the gold
and parcel-gilt altar-frontal dome by our Anglo-Saxon countryman
Walwin for the Ambrosian basilican church at Milan; it is seen upon the
narrow border round some embroidery of the twelfth century, lately found
within a shrine in Belgium, and figured by that untiring archæologist
the Canon Voisin of Tournay; and upon a piece of English needlework
of the latter half of the same twelfth century&mdash;the mitre of our St.
Thomas, figured by Shaw, and still kept at Sens cathedral. As a favourite
element in the pattern worked upon our ecclesiastical embroideries, this
“gammadion” is as conspicuously shown upon the apparel round the
shoulders, and on the one in front of his alb, in the effigy of Bishop
Edington, at Winchester cathedral, as upon the vestments of a priest in
a grave-brass at Shottesbrook church, Berks, given by Waller in his fine
work.</p>

<p>Always keeping up its heathenish signification of a “future life,”
Christianity widened the meaning of this symbol, and made it teach the
doctrine of the Atonement through the death of our Lord upon a cross.
Furthermore, it set forth that He is our corner-stone. About the
thirteenth century, it was taken to be an apt memorial of His five
wounds; and remembering the stigmata or five impressions in the hands,
feet, and side of St. Francis of Assisi, this gammadion became the favourite
device of such as bore that famous saint’s name, and was called in England,
after its partial likeness to the ensigne of the Isle of Man&mdash;three
feet&mdash;a fylfot.<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a></p>

<p>To the symbolic meaning affixed unto some animals, we have pointed in
the catalogue, wherein, at p. <a href="#Page_156">156</a>, the reader will find that Christ, as God,
is typified under the figure of a lion, under that again of the unicorn, as
God-man. Man’s soul, at pp. <a href="#Page_237">237</a>, <a href="#Page_311">311</a>, is figured as the hare; mischief
and lubricity are, at p. <a href="#Page_311">311</a>, shadowed forth in the likeness of the
monkey.</p>

<p>Birds often come in here as symbols; and of course we behold the
lordly eagle very frequently. Bearing in mind how struggled the two great
factions of the Guelphs whose armorial arms were “un’ Aquila con
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_cxli">[Pg cxli]</span>
un Drago sotto i piedi”&mdash;an eagle with a dragon under its feet&mdash;and the
Ghibellini, we do not wonder at finding the noble bird, sometimes
single, sometimes double-headed, so frequently figured on silks woven in
Sicily, or on the Italian peninsula, triumphing over his enemy, the dragon
or Ghibelline stretched down before him. About the emblematic eagle
of classic times we have already spoken.</p>

<p>If the Roman Quintus Curtius, like the Greeks before him, was in
amazement at certain birds in India, so quick in mimicking the human
voice: “aves ad imitandum humanæ vocis sonum dociles,”<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> we naturally
expect to find the parrot figured, as we do here, upon stuffs from
Asia, or imitations of such webs.</p>

<p>Famous, in eastern story, are those knowing birds&mdash;and they were
parrots&mdash;that, on coming home at evening, used to whisper unto Æthiopia’s
queen (whom Englishmen not till the sixteenth century began to
call Sheba, but all the world besides called and yet calls Saba) each word
and doing, that day, of the far-off Solomon, or brought round their necks
letters from him. Out of this Talmudic fable grew the method
with artists during the fifteenth century of figuring one of the wise men
as very swarthy&mdash;an Æthiopian&mdash;under the name of Balthasar, taking as
their warrant, a work called “Collectaneæ,” erroneously assigned to our
own Beda; and because our Salisbury books for the liturgy, sang, as all
the old liturgies yet sing, on the feast of the Epiphany:&mdash;“All shall come
from Saba”&mdash;the name of the country as well as of that queen who once
governed it&mdash;“bringing gold and frankincense,” &amp;c. those mediæval
artists deemed it proper to show somewhere about the wise men, parrots,
as sure to have been brought among the other gifts, especially from the
land of Saba. Upon a cope, belonging now to Mount St. Mary’s,
Chesterfield, made of very rich crimson velvet, there is beautifully embroidered
by English hands, the arrival at Bethlehem of the three wise
men. In the orphrey, on that part just above the hood, are figured in
their proper colours two parrots, as those may remember who saw it in
the Exhibition here of 1862; on textiles before us this bird is often
shown. The appearance of the parrot on the vestments at old St. Paul’s
is very frequent.<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a></p>

<p>But of the feathered tribe which we meet with figured on these textiles,
there are three that merit an especial mention through the important
part they were made to take, whilom in England at many a high festival
and regal celebration&mdash;we mean the so-called “<i>Vow of the Swan, the
Peacock and the Pheasant</i>.” From the graceful ease&mdash;the almost royal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_cxlii">[Pg cxlii]</span>
dignity with which it walks the waters, the swan with its plumage spotless
and white as driven snow, has everywhere been looked upon with
admiring eyes; and its flesh while yet a cygnet used to be esteemed a
dainty for a royal board, on some extraordinary occasions. To make it
the symbol of majestic beauty in a woman, it had sometimes given it a
female’s head. Among the gifts bestowed on his son, Richard II. by
the Black Prince, in his will were bed-hangings embroidered with white
swans having women’s heads. To raise this bird still higher, in ecclesiastical
symbolism, it is put forth to indicate a stainless, more than royal
purity; and as such, is often linked with and figured under the Blessed
Virgin Mary, as is shown upon an enamelled morse given in the
“Church of our Fathers.”<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a></p>

<p>Besides all this, the swan owns a curious legend of its own, set forth by
some raving troubadour in the wildest dream that minstrel ever dreamed.
“The life and myraculous hystory of the most noble and illustryous
Helyas, knight of the swanne, and the birth of y<sup>e</sup> excellent knight
Godfrey of Boulyon,” &amp;c., was once a book in great favour throughout
Europe; and was “newly translated and printed by Robert Copland, out
of Frensshe in to Englisshe at thinstigacion of y<sup>e</sup> Puyssaunt and Illustryous
Prynce Lorde Edwarde Duke of Buckyngham&mdash;of whom lynyally is
dyscended my sayde lorde.”<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a></p>

<p>While our noble countryman boasted of an offspring from this fabled
swan, so did the greatest houses abroad. In private hands in England is
a precious ivory casket wrought on its five panels, before us in photography,
with this history of the swan. Helyas’s shield and flag are
ensigned with St. George’s cross; the armour tells of England and its
military appliances, about the end of the fourteenth century; and the
whole seems the work of English hands. At the great exhibition of
loans in this museum, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1862, one of the many fine textiles then
shown was a fine but cut-down chasuble of blue Sicilian silk, upon
which was, curiously enough for what we have said about the birds
before which the “Vow” was made, figured, amid other fowls the
pheasant. The handsome orphreys upon this vestment were wrought
in this country, and good specimens they are of English needlework
during the fourteenth century. These orphreys, before and behind, are
embroidered on a bright red silk ground, with golden flower and leaf-bearing
branches, so trailed as, in their twinings, to form Stafford knots
in places, and to embower shields of arms each supported by gold swans
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_cxliii">[Pg cxliii]</span>
all once ducally gorged. From these and other bearings on it, this chasuble
would seem to have been worked for the Staffords, Dukes of Buckingham.
At Corby Castle there is an altar frontal of crimson velvet made for
and figured with the great Buckingham and his Duchess both on their
knees at the foot of a crucifix. Amid a sprinkling of the Stafford
knot, for the Duke (Henry VIII. beheaded him) was Earl of Stafford,
the swan is shown, and the Lord Stafford of Cossey, in whose veins the
blood of the old Buckingham still runs, gives a silver swan as one of his
armorial supporters. At Lincoln cathedral there were:&mdash;A cope
of red cloth of gold with swans of gold;<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> and a cope of purple velvet
having a good orphrey set with swans.<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a></p>

<p>In mediæval symbolism, as read by Englishmen, the swan was deemed
not only a royal bird, but, more than that, one of the tokens of royal
prowess. Hence we may easily understand why our great warrior king,
Edward I., as he sat feasting in Westminster Hall, amid all the chivalry,
old and young of the kingdom, on such a memorable day, should have
had brought before him the two swans in their golden cages:&mdash;“tunc
allati sunt in pompatica gloria duo cygni vel olores, ante regem, phalerati
retibus aureis, vel fistulis deauratis, desiderabile spectaculum, intuentibus.
Quibus visis, rex votum vovit Deo cœli et cygnis, se proficisci in
Scotiam,” &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> And then solemnly made the “Vow of the Swan,” as
we described, p. <a href="#Page_287">287</a> of the Catalogue.</p>

<p>In the pride of place, on such occasions, abreast with the swan stood
the peacock, “with his angel fethers bright;” and was at all times and
everywhere looked upon as the emblem of beauty. Not a formal
banquet was ever given, at one period, without this bird being among the
dishes; in fact, the principal one. To prepare it for the table, it had
been killed and skinned with studious care. When roasted, it was sewed
up in its skin after such an artistic way that its crested head and azure
neck were kept, as in nature, quite upright; and its fan-like tail outspread;
and then, put in a sitting position on a large broad silver dish
parcel gilt, used to be brought into the hall with much solemnity.</p>

<p>On the last day of a tournament, its gay festivities ended in a more
than usual sumptuous banqueting. The large baronial hall was hung all
over with hangings, sometimes figured with a romance, sometimes with
scenes such as we read of in “The Flower and the Leaf;” and because
trees abounded on them, were known as tapestry of “verd.” At top of
and all along the travers ran the minstrel-gallery, and thither&mdash;</p>

<p>Treading out sweetness from the bay leaves strewed among the rushes
on the floor, and with step as stately as the peacock’s own, the queen of
beauty for the nonce, bearing in both her hands the splendid charger
with the bird&mdash;the symbol of herself&mdash;slowly paced the hall. Halting
on a sudden, she set it down before the knight who, by general accord,
had borne him best throughout that tournament; such was the ladies’ token
of their praises. To carve well at table was one of the accomplishments
of ancient chivalry; and our own King Arthur was so able in that gentle
craft, that on one occasion he is said to have cut up a peacock so
cleverly that every one among the one hundred and fifty guests had a
morsel of the fowl. To show himself as good a knight at a feast as at a
passage of arms, the lady bade him carve the bird. What the lances of
his antagonists could not do, this meed of praise from the ladies did&mdash;it
overcame him. With deference, he humbly pleaded that many a
doughty knight there present was more worthy of the honour: all his
words were wasted. The queen of beauty would brook no gainsaying to
her behest. He therefore bowed obedience, and she went away. Ere
applying himself to his devoir, outstretching his right hand on high above
the dish before him, amid the deepest silence, and in a ringing voice, so
as to be well heard by all that noble presence, the knight vowed his vow
of the peacock. Almost always this vow was half religious, half military;
and he who took it bound himself to go on pilgrimage to the Holy
Land, and, on his road thither or homeward, to join, as he might, any
crusade against the Paynim.</p>

<p>Hardly had the words of such a plight been uttered, when other
knights started up at every table, and bound themselves by his or some
like vow.</p>

<p>The dinner done, the feast was not quite over. Plucking from its tail
the best and brightest of the peacock’s feathers, the beauty-queen wove
them into a diadem; the minstrel who had long distinguished himself,
was summoned by a pursuivant and brought before her; and she crowned
him as he knelt lowly down. Ever afterwards, at festival or tournament,
this music king wore this crown about his hat as blithely as did
the knight his lady’s glove or favour on his helmet, at a joust. Such
was&mdash;</p>

<p>Sometimes a pheasant, on account of its next beautiful plumage, used
to be employed, instead of the larger, grander peacock.</p>

<p>With these facts set before him, any visitor to this collection will take
a much more lively interest in so precious a piece of English embroidery
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_cxlvi">[Pg cxlvi]</span>
as is the Syon cope, for while looking at it in admiration of the art-work
shown in such a splendid church vestment, he finds, where he never

<p>Besides all that has been said in reference to this cope, at pp. <a href="#Page_289">289-90</a>
of the Catalogue, we would remind our reader that at easy distances
from Coventry might be found such lordly castles as those of Warwick,
Kenilworth, Chartley, Minster Lovel, Tamworth. The holding of a
tournament within their spacious walls, or in the fields beside them, was,
we may be certain, of frequent occurrence at some one or other of
them. The tilting was followed by the banquet and the “vow;” and
the vow by its fulfilment from those barons bold, who bore in their own
day the stirring names of Beauchamp, Warwick, Ferrers, Geneville, or
Mortimer. Of one or other of them might be said:&mdash;</p>

<p>At Warwick itself, and again at Temple Balsall, not far off, the Knights
Templars held a preceptory, and, as it is likely, aggregated to the Coventry
gild, had their badge&mdash;the Holy Lamb&mdash;figured on its vestment. Proud of
all its brotherhood, proud of those high lords who had gone on pilgrimage
to the Holy Land, figured by the Star of Bethlehem, and had done battle
with the Moslem, according to the vow signified by the swan and
peacock, the Coventry gild caused to be embroidered on the orphrey of
their fine old cope, the several armorial bearings of those among their
brotherhood who had swelled the fame of England abroad; and by
putting those symbols&mdash;the swan and the peacock, the star and crescent&mdash;close
by their blazons, meant to remind the world of those festive doings
which led each of them to work such deeds of hardihood.</p>

<p>In the fourteenth century a fashion grew up here in England of
figuring symbolism&mdash;heraldic and religious&mdash;upon the articles of dress, as
we gather from specimens here, as well as from other sources. The
ostrich feather, first assumed by our Black Prince, was a favourite device
with his son Richard II. for his flags and personal garments. This is
well shown in the illumination given, p. 31, of the “Deposition of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_cxlvii">[Pg cxlvii]</span>
Richard II.,” published by the Antiquarian Society. That king’s mother
had bequeathed to him a new bed of red velvet, embroidered with ostrich
feathers of silver, and heads of leopards of gold, with boughs and leaves
issuing out of their mouths.<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> Through family feeling, not merely the
white swan, but this cognizance of the Yorkists&mdash;the ostrich feather&mdash;was
sometimes figured on orphreys for church copes and chasubles, since
in the Exeter, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1506, we find mentioned a cope, “le orfrey de rubeo
damasco operato de opere acuali cum rosis aureis ac ostryge fethers
insertis in rosis,” &amp;c.;<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> and again, “le orfrey de blodio serico operata de
opere acuali cum cignis albis et ostryge fethers&mdash;i casula de blodio serico
operata opere acuali cum ostryge fethers sericis, le orfrey de rubeo serico
operato cum ostryge fethers aureis.”<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> Lincoln Cathedral, too, had a
cope of red damask, with ostriges feathers of silver.<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> This somewhat

<p>To eyes like our own, accustomed to see nowhere but in English
heraldry, and English devices, harts figured as lodged beneath green trees
in a park as in <a href="#h-1283">Nos. 1283-4</a>, p. 43, or stags couchant, with a chain
about the neck, as at pp. <a href="#Page_53">53</a>, <a href="#Page_239">239</a>, and in both samples gazing upward to
the sun behind a cloud, it would appear that they were but varieties of
the pattern sketched for the silken stuffs worn by Richard II., and
admirably shown on that valuable, yet hitherto overlooked specimen of
English mediæval workmanship in copper and engraving still to be found
in Westminster Abbey, as we before observed,<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> and the symbolism of
which we now explain. The pattern of the silken textile worn by the
king consists of but three elements&mdash;the broom-pod, the sun’s rays
darting upwards from behind a cloud, and a stag lying down on the
grass, looking right forward, with about its neck a royal crown, down
from which falls a long chain. The broom tells, of course, that Richard
was a Plantagenet. His grandfather’s favourite cognizance was that of
sunbeams issuing from clouds; his mother’s&mdash;Joan, the fair maid of
Kent&mdash;the white hart. The latter two were evidently meant to bring
to mind the words of the Psalmist, who says:&mdash;“The heavens show
forth the glory of God. He hath set His tabernacle in the sun. The
Lord is my light, and His throne as the sun.” The white hind brings
to our thoughts how the hart panting for the water-fountains, is likened
to the soul that pants after God. This symbolism is unfolded into a
wider breadth upon the design for the stuffs here, <a href="#h-1310">No. 1310</a>, p. 53; No.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_cxlviii">[Pg cxlviii]</span>
<a href="#h-8624">8624</a>, p. 239. Here, instead of the sunbeams shooting upwards, as if to
light the whole heavens, they dart downward, as if for the individual
stag with upturned gaze, amid a gentle shower of rain; as if to say that
if man look heavenward by prayer, light will be sent down to him, and
helping grace, like rain, like the shower upon the grass to slake his
ghostly thirst.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_435" href="#FNanchor_435" class="label">[435]</a> P. cxx.</p>

</div>

<p>About the time of Richard II. the white hart seems to have been a
favourite element in ornamental needlework here in England, for Lincoln
cathedral had “a red velvet cope set with white harts lying, colours
(with collars?) full of these letters S S ... the harts having crowns
upon their necks with chains, silver and gilt,” &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> So thoroughly
national at the time was this emblem that we believe every piece of silken
textile to be found here or elsewhere had its design sketched in this
country and sent to Palermo to be woven there in stuffs for the use of
the English court. When his order had been done, the weaver having
his loom geared at our king’s expense, threw off a certain quantity of the
same pattern for home use or his trade with Germany; and hence we
see such a beautiful variation figured on the apparels upon the old alb,
No. <a href="#h-8710">8710</a>, p. 268 of the catalogue. The eagle shown all in gold, with
a crown not on but above its head, may refer to one of Richard’s ancestors,
the King of the Romans, who never reigned as such. The hart,
collared and lodged in its park, is Richard’s own emblem. That dog,
collared and courant, has a story of its own in Richard’s eventful life.
Dogs when petted and great favourites, were always arrayed in ornamented
collars; hence we must not be surprised to find put down among
the things of value kept in the Treasury of the Exchequer:&mdash;“ii
grehondes colers of silk enbrouded with lettres of gold and garnyssed
with silver and overgilt.”<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> Telling of Richard’s capture in Flint castle
by the Earl of Derby, soon afterwards Henry IV., Froissart says:&mdash;“King
Richard had a greyhound called Math, beautiful beyond measure
who would not notice nor follow any one but the king. Whenever the
king rode abroad the greyhound was loosed by the person who had him
in charge, and ran instantly to caress him, by placing his two fore feet on
his shoulders. It fell out that as the king and the Duke of Lancaster
were conversing in the court of the castle, their horses being ready for
them to mount, the greyhound was untied, but instead of running as
usual to the king, he left him, and leaped to the Duke of Lancaster’s
shoulders, paying him every court, and caressing him as he was formerly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_cxlix">[Pg cxlix]</span>
used to caress the king. The duke asked the king, ‘What does this
mean?’ ‘Cousin,’ replied the king, ‘it means a great deal for you, and
very little for me. This greyhound fondles and pays his court to you
this day as King of England.’”<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> That such a pet as Math once so
given to fawn upon his royal master should, with other emblematic
animals, have been figured in the pattern on a textile meant for its
master’s wear, or that of his court, seems very likely: and thus the piece
before us possesses a more than ordinary interest.</p>

<p>Respecting ecclesiastical symbolism, we have to observe that with
regard to the subjects figured upon these liturgical embroideries, we may
see at a glance, that the one untiring wish, both of the designer and of
those who had to wear those vestments, was to set before the people’s
eyes and to bring as often as possible to their mind the divinity of Christ,
strongly and unmistakably, along with the grand doctrine of the Atonement.
Whether it be cope, or chasuble, or reredos, or altar-frontal such
a teaching is put forth upon it. Beginning with the divinity of our
Saviour’s manhood, sometimes we have shown us how, with such lowly
reverence, Gabriel spoke his message to the Blessed Virgin Mary with
the mystic three-flowered lily standing up between them; or the Nativity
with the shepherds or the wise men kneeling in adoration to acknowledge
the divinity of our Lord even as a child just born; then some event in
His life, His passion, His scourging at the pillar, the bearing of His cross,
His being crowned with thorns, always His crucifixion, often above that,
His upraised person like a king enthroned and crowning her of whom He
had taken flesh; while everywhere about the vestment are represented
apostles, martyrs, and saints all nimbed with glory, and among them,
winged seraphim standing upon wheels, signifying that heaven is now
thrown open to fallen but redeemed man, who, by the atonement
wrought for him by our Divine Redeemer, is made to become the fellow-companion
of angels and cherubim. To this same end, the black vestments
worn at the services for the dead were, according to the old English
rite, marked; the chasubles on the back with a green cross upon a red
ground, the copes with a red orphrey at their sides, to remind those
present that while they mourned their departed friend, they must
believe that his soul could never enter heaven unless made clean and regenerated
by the atoning blood shed for it on the cross.</p>

<p>At his dubbing, “unto a knight is given a sword, which is made in
the semblance of the cross, for to signify how our Lord God vanquished
in the cross the death of human lineage, to the which he was judged for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_cl">[Pg cl]</span>
the sin of our first father Adam.” This we are told in the “Order of
Chivalry,” translated by Caxton.<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> While stretched wounded and dying
on the battle-field, some friendly hand would stick a sword into the
ground before the expiring knight, that as in its handle he beheld this
symbol of the cross, he might forgive him who had struck him down, as
he hoped forgiveness for himself, through the atonement paid for him on
the cross at Calvary.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_439" href="#FNanchor_439" class="label">[439]</a> Typographical Antiquities, ed. Dibdin, t. i. p. 234.</p>
</div>

<p>The ages of chivalry were times of poetry, and we therefore feel no
surprise on finding that each young knight was taught to learn that belonging
to every article of his armour, to every colour of his silken array,
there was a symbolism which he ought to know. All these emblematic
significations are set forth in the “Order of Chivalry,” which we just now
quoted. The work is very rare, but the chapter on this subject is given
by Ames in his “Typographical Antiquities of Great Britain;”<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> as
well as in “Lancelot du Lac” modernized and printed in the “Bibliothèque
Bleu,” pp. 11, 12. In that black silk chasuble with a red
orphrey upon which our Lord is figured hanging upon a green cross&mdash;“cum
crucifixo pendente in viridi cruce,”<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> it was for a particular
reason that the colour of this wood for the cross is specified: as green
is the tint of dress put on by the new-born budding year, which thus
foretells of flowers and fruits in after months, so was this same colour
the symbol of regeneration for mankind, and the promise of paradise
hereafter. For such a symbolic reason is it that, upon the wall
painting lately brought again to light in West Somerton Church,
Norfolk, our uprisen Lord is shown stepping out of the grave, mantled
in green, with the banner of the resurrection in His left hand, and giving
a blessing with His upraised right. At all times, and in every land, the
“Language of Flowers” has been cultivated, and those who now
make it their study will find much to their purpose in Chaucer, especially
in his “Flower and the Leaf.” There speaking of “Diane,
goddesse of chastite,” the poet says:&mdash;</p>

<p>Were it not for this symbolism for the woodbine, we had been quite
unable to understand why in our old testamentary bequests, the flower
should have been so especially mentioned as we find in the will of Joan
Lady Bergavenny who, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1434, leaves to one of her friends, a “bed
of silk, black and red, embroidered with woodbined flowers of
silver,” &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> Besides its symbolism of those colours&mdash;black and red&mdash;for
which we have but this moment given the reasons, p. cxlix., the
funeral cope which we noticed before, p. <a href="#Page_cxxvi">cxxvi</a>., showed a symbolism of
flowers in the woodbine wrought upon it. Sure may we be that the
donor’s wish&mdash;perhaps the fingers of a weeping widow had worked it
for Lincoln Cathedral&mdash;was to tell for her in after days the unfaltering
love she ever bore towards her husband, and to say so every time this
vestment happened to be worn at the services sounded for him. May
be that quaint old likeness of Anne Vavasour, exhibited here <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1868
among the “National Portraits,” and numbered 680, p. 138 of the
Catalogue, had its background trailed all over with branches of the
woodbine in leaf, at the particular behest of a fond spouse Sir H. Lee,
and so managed that the plant’s only cyme of flower should hang just
below her bosom. By Shakespeare floral symbolism was well understood;
and he often shows his knowledge of it in “A Winter’s Tale,” act iv.
scene iii. He gives us several meanings of flower-speech, and when he
makes (Henry VIII. act iv. scene ii.) Queen Katherine say to Griffith
“Farewell&mdash;when I am dead&mdash;strew me over with maiden flowers, that
all the world may know I was a chaste wife to my grave,” he tells of
an olden custom still kept up among us, and more fully carried out in
Wales and the Western parts of England, where the grave of a dear
departed one is weekly dressed by loving hands with the prettiest flowers
that may be had. The symbolism of colours is learnedly treated by
Portal in his “Couleurs Symboliques.”</p>

<p>The readers of those valuable inventories of the chasubles, copes, and
other liturgical silk garments which belonged to Exeter cathedral and
that of London, about the middle of the thirteenth century, will not fail
to observe that some of them bore, amongst other animals, the horse, and
fish of different sorts, nay, porpoises figured on them: “una capa de palla
cum porphesiis et leonibus deauratis,”<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> “due cape de palla cum equis et
avibus,”<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> “unum pulvinar breudatum avibus, piscibus et bestiis,”<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> “capa
de quodam panno Tarsico, viridis coloris cum pluribus piscibus et rosis
aurifilo contextis.”<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> Even here, under <a href="#h-8229">No. 8229</a>, p. 151, we have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_clii">[Pg clii]</span>
from the East a small shred of crimson silk, which shows on it a flat-shaped
fish. If to some minds it be a subject of wonderment that,
amid flowers and fruits, not only birds and beasts&mdash;elephants included&mdash;but
such odd things as fish, even the porpoise, are to be found represented
upon textiles chosen for the service of the altar, they should
learn that all such stuffs were gladly put to this very use for the symbolism
they carried, by accident, about them. Then, as now, the
clergy had to say, and the people to listen daily to that canticle: “O
all ye works of the Lord, bless ye the Lord; O ye angels of the Lord,
O ye whales, and all that move in the waters, O ye fowls of the air,
O all ye beasts and cattle, bless ye the Lord and magnify Him for ever!”
Not merely churchmen, but the lay folks, deemed it but fitting that while
the prayer above was being offered up, an emphasis should be given to
its words by the very garment worn by the celebrant as he uttered
them.</p>

For</span> those who bestow their attention upon Literature
and Languages, this collection must have, at times, an
especial value, whichever way their choice may lead them,
whether towards subjects of biblical, classic or mediæval
study: proofs of this, we think, may be gathered, up and down the whole
of this “Introduction.” With regard to our own country, we deem it
quite impossible for any one among us to properly know the doings, in
private and in public, throughout this land in by-gone days, or to take in
all the beauty of many a passage in our prose writers, much less understand
several particulars in the poetry of the middle ages, without an
acquaintance, such as may be made here, with the textiles and needlework
of that period.</p>

<p>To the student of languages, it may seem, at first sight, that he will
have nothing to learn by coming hither. When he looks at those two
very curious and interesting pieces, Nos. <a href="#h-1297">1297</a>, p. 296; <a href="#h-1465">1465</a>, p. 298,
and has read the scrolls traced upon them, he may perhaps, if he be in
search of the older forms of German speech, have to change his mind:
of the words, so often to be met with here, in real or pretended Arabic,
we say nothing. To almost every one among our English students of
languages there is one inscription done in needlework quite unreadable.
At <a href="#h-8278">No. 8278</a>, p. 170, going round the four sides of this liturgical
appliance, are sentences in Greek, borrowed from the ritual, but hidden
to the Greek scholar’s eye, under the so-called Cyrillian character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_cliii">[Pg cliii]</span></p>

<p>Toward the second half of the ninth century, a monk, known in
his cloister under the name of Constantine, but afterwards, when a
bishop, as Cyrillus, became earnestly wishful of bringing all the many
tribes of the Sclavonic race to a knowledge of Christianity; and warming
in the heart of his brother Methodius a like hope, they both bethought
themselves, the sooner to succeed, of inventing an alphabet which should
be better adapted for that purpose than either the Greek or the Latin
one; and because its invention is owing, for the greater part, to St.
Cyril, it immediately took, and still keeps, its name from him, and is
now denominated Cyrillian. Of this invention we are told by Pope
John VIII. to whom the two brothers had gone together, to ask
authority and crave his blessing for their undertaking: “Letteras Sclavonicas,
a Constantino quodam philosopho repertas, quibus Deo laudes
debitæ resonant. Ep. ad Svaplukum, apud Dobrowsky, Institutiones
Linguæ Slavicæ.” This great and successful missionary took not any
Gothic, but a Greek model for his letters, as is shown by Dobrowsky.
The Sclaves who follow the Greek rite, use the Cyrillian letters in their
liturgical books, while those of the same people who use the Latin rite
employ, in their service, the Glagolitic alphabet, which was drawn up in
the thirteenth century. The probability is that this latter&mdash;a modification
of the Cyrillian, is no older than that period, and is not from the
hand, as supposed by some, of St. Jerom.</p>

<p>A short time ago, the Sclaves celebrated with great splendour the
thousandth anniversary of St. Cyril, to whom they owe their Christianity
and their alphabet; and among the beautiful wall paintings lately
brought to light in the lower church of St. Clement at Rome, by the
zealous labours of Father Malooly, an Irish Dominican, the translation
of St. Cyril’s body from the Vatican, to that church, is figured.</p>

And</span> how the appearance of it, real or imagined, under any
shape, and upon vestments, was made available, after different
ways, in our law-courts, ask for and shall have a
passing notice.</p>

<p>At the end of the fourteenth century, there arose, between the noble
houses of Scrope and Grosvenor, a difference about the legal right of
bearing on their respective shields the bend <i>or</i> on a field <i>azure</i>; and the
suit was carried to the Court of Honour which sat at Westminster, and
commissioners were sent about the country for the purpose of gathering
evidence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_cliv">[Pg cliv]</span></p>

<p>Besides a numerous body of the nobility, several distinguished churchmen
were examined; and their depositions are curious. John, Abbot
of St. Agatha, in Richmondshire, said the arms (<i>Azure</i>, a bend <i>or</i>, the
bearing of the Scrope family who contended against its assumption by the
Grosvenors) were on a corporas case belonging to the church of his
monastery, of which the Scropes were deemed the second founders.<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a>
John de Cloworthe, sub-prior of Wartre, exhibited before the commissioners
an amice embroidered on red velvet with leopards and griffons
<i>or</i>, between which are sewn in silk, in three pieces, three escochens with
the entire arms of Sir Richard Scrope therein, viz.&mdash;<i>azure</i> a bend <i>or</i>.<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a>
William, Prior of Lanercost, said they had in their church the same
arms embroidered on the morse of a cope.<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> Sir Simon, parson of
Wenslay (whose fine grave brass may be seen in the “Church of Our
Fathers,”<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a>) placed before the commissioners an albe with flaps, upon
which were embroidered the arms of the Scropes entire, &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> The
Scropes were the patrons of that living. Thomas de Cotyngham, prior
of the Abbey of St. Mary, York, said that they had vestments with the
Scrope arms upon them.<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> Sir John de Manfeld, parson of the Church
of St. Mary sur Rychille, in York, said that in the church were diverse
vestments on which were sewn, in silk, the entire arms of Scrope.<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a>
Sir Bertram Mountboucher said that these arms of the Scropes were to
be seen on vestments, &amp;c., in the abbey and churches where Sir R.
Scrope was born.<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> Not the least remarkable individual who bore evidence
on the subject was the poet Chaucer, who was produced on
behalf of Sir Richard Scrope. When asked whether the arms <i>azure</i>, a
bend <i>or</i>, belonged, or ought to belong to the said Sir Richard? said yes,
for he saw him so armed in France, &amp;c., and that all his time he had seen
the said arms in banners, glass, paintings and vestments, and commonly
called the Arms of Scrope.<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> For the better understanding of all these
evidences the reader should look at <a href="#h-8307">No. 8307</a>, p. 185, an amice with
its old apparel still on it. The “flaps” of an alb are now called
apparels; and an old one, with these ornaments upon it, both at the
cuffs as well as before and behind, is in this collection, <a href="#h-8710">No. 8710</a>, p. 268
of the Catalogue. The two fine old English apparels here, <a href="#h-8128">No. 8128</a>,
p. 146, show how shields with heraldry could be put along with Scriptural
subjects in these embroideries. The monumental effigy of a priest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_clv">[Pg clv]</span>
&mdash;a Percy by birth&mdash;in Beverley Minster, exhibits how these apparels, on
an amice, were sometimes wrought with armorial bearings. Of “corporas
cases,” there are several here, and pointed out at pp. <a href="#Page_112">112</a>, <a href="#Page_144">144</a>, <a href="#Page_145">145</a>,
and <a href="#Page_194">194</a> of the Catalogue.</p>

<p>Margaret, Countess of Salisbury, the last of the Plantagenets, and
mother of Lord Montague and Cardinal Pole, was, like her son the
peer, beheaded, and at the age of seventy, by their kinsman Henry
VIII. This fact is recorded by Collier;<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> but Miss A. Strickland
mentions it more at length in these words:&mdash;Cromwell produced in the
House of Lords, May 10th, by way of evidence against the aged
Countess of Salisbury, a vestment (a chasuble no doubt) of white silk
that had been found in her wardrobe, embroidered in front with the
arms of England, surrounded with a wreath of pansies and marigolds,
and on the back the representation of the host with the five wounds of
our Lord, and the name of Jesus written in the midst. The peers permitted
the unprincipled minister to persuade them that this was a treasonable
ensign, and as the Countess had corresponded with her absent son
(Cardinal Pole) she was for no other crime attainted of high treason, and
condemned to death without the privilege of being heard in her own
defence.<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> The arms of England, amid the quarterings of some great
families, are even now to be found upon vestments; a beautiful one was
exhibited here, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1862, and described in the Loan Catalogue, p. 266;
another fine one is at present at Abergavenny. With regard to the
representation of the “Host with the five wounds of our Lord,” &amp;c.
this is of very common occurrence in ecclesiastical embroidery; and in
this very collection, on the back orphrey to the splendid chasuble, No.
<a href="#h-8704">8704</a>, p. 264 of this Catalogue, we find embroidered the crucifixion,
and a shield <i>gules</i>, with a chalice <i>or</i> and a host <i>argent</i> at top, done in
Flanders full half a century before the “Pilgrimage of Grace” in our
northern counties had adopted such a common device upon their banner
when the people there arose up against Henry VIII.</p>

<p>To a Surrey, for winning the day at Flodden Field, King Henry VIII.
gave the tressured lion of the royal arms of Scotland to be borne upon
the Howard bend as arms of augmentation. In after years, the same
Henry VIII. cut off a Surrey’s head because he bore, as his House had
borne from the time of one of their forefathers, Thomas de Brotherton,
Edward I.’s son, the arms of the Confessor, the use of which had been
confirmed to it by Richard II. If, like Scrope, Surrey had bethought
himself of vestments, even of the few we have with the royal arms upon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_clvi">[Pg clvi]</span>
them, and assumed by other English noblemen, perhaps those liturgic
embroideries might have stood him in some good stead to save his life.
Had the poor aged Countess of Salisbury been heard, she might have
shamed her kinsman the king not to take her life for using upon her
church furniture emblems, then as now, employed upon such appliances
throughout all Christendom.</p>

<p>For the genealogist, the lawyer, the herald, the historian, such of
these old liturgical garments as, like the Syon cope, bear armorial shields
embroidered upon them, will have a peculiar value, and a more than
ordinary interest. Those emblazonries not only recall the names of
men bound up for ever with this land’s history, but may again serve, as
they once before have served, to furnish the lost link in a broken pedigree,
or unravel an entangled point before a law tribunal.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">
By</span> all those for whom, among other allurements drawing
them on in their studies of Botany and Zoology, one is
the gratification they feel in learning how many of the
subjects belonging to these two sections of the natural
sciences were known, and how they used to be depicted during the
middle ages, this large collection of textiles figured so often with birds,
beasts and flowers, will be heartily welcomed.</p>

<p>Our Zoological Society prides itself, and in justice, with treating the
Londoners with the first sight of a live giraffe; but here its members
themselves may behold, <a href="#h-8591">Nos. 8591-91<span class="allsmcap">A</span></a>, p. 224; <a href="#h-8599">8599</a>, p. 228, the
earliest known portrait of that curious quadruped sketched upon Sicilian
silks of the fourteenth century.</p>

<p>We once listened to a discussion between English sportsmen about the
travels of the pheasant from its native home by the banks of the river
Phasis at Colchis, and the time when it reached this island. Both
parties agreed in believing its coming hither to have been somewhat late.
Be that as it may, our country gentlemen will see their favourite bird
figured here, <a href="#h-1325">No. 1325</a>, p. 60.</p>

<p>About the far-famed hunting cheetahs of India, we have heard, and
still hear much; and on pieces of silk from eastern looms, in this
collection, they are often to be seen figured.</p>

<p>With regard to the way in which all kinds of fowl, as well as animals
are represented on these stuffs, there is one thing which we think will
strike most observers who compare the drawing of them here with that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_clvii">[Pg clvii]</span>
of the same objects among the illuminations in old MSS. The birds and
beasts on the textiles are always very much better rendered than in the
wood-cuts to be found in our old black-letter books, from Caxton’s
days upwards, especially in such works as that of Æsop and the rest.
Figures of animals and of birds in manuscripts are hardly better, as we
may see in the prints of our own Sir John Maundevile’s Travels, and the
French “Bestiaire d’Amour,” par R. de Fournival, lately edited by C.
Hippeau. Scarcely better does their design fare in illuminated MSS.
Belonging to the Duke of Northumberland, and now in the library at
Alnwick castle is the finest Salisbury missal we have ever beheld. This
tall thick folio volume was, some time during the end of the fourteenth
century, begun to be written and illuminated by a Benedictine monk&mdash;one
John Whas&mdash;who carried on this gorgeous book as far as page 661.
From the two Leonine verses which we read there, it would seem that
this labour of love carried on for years at early morn in the scriptorium
belonging to Sherbourne Abbey, Dorsetshire, had broken, as well it
might, the health of the monk artist, of whom it is said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Librum scribendo Ion Whas monachus laborabat;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Et mane surgendo multum corpus macerabat.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Among his other tastes, this Benedictine had that for Natural History,
and in the beautifully illuminated Kalendar at the beginning of this full
missal, almost every month is pointed out by the presence of some bird,
or fish, or flower, peculiar to that season, with its name beneath it,&mdash;for
instance, “Ys is a throstle,” &amp;c. However much the thrush’s song may
have cheered him at his work at Spring-tide peep of day, Whas did
not draw his bird with half the individuality and truthfulness which we
find in birds of all sorts that are figured upon Sicilian stuffs woven at
the very period when the English Benedictine was at work within the
cloisters of his house in Dorsetshire&mdash;a fact which may lead the ornithologist
to look with more complacency upon those textiles here patterned
with Italian birds.</p>

<p>For Botany, it has not gone so well; yet, notwithstanding this drawback,
there are to be seen figured upon these textiles plants and trees
which, though strangers to this land and to Europe, and their forms no
doubt, oddly and clumsily represented, yet, as they keep about them the
same character, we may safely believe to have a true type in nature,
which at last by their help we shall be able to find out. Such is the
famous “homa,” or “hom,”&mdash;the sacred tree&mdash;among the ancient followers
of Zoroaster, as well as the later Persians. It is to be seen figured
on many silks in this collection of real or imitated Persian textiles, woven
at various periods during the middle ages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_clviii">[Pg clviii]</span></p>

<p>From the earliest antiquity a tradition came down throughout middle
Asia, of some holy tree&mdash;perhaps the tree of life spoken of as growing
in Paradise.&mdash;Gen. ii. 9. Some such a tree is very often to be seen
sculptured on Assyrian monuments; and, by the place which it holds
there, must have been held in peculiar, nay religious veneration. Upon
those important remains from Nineveh, now in the British Museum,
and figured in Mr. Layard’s fine work, it appears as the object of
homage for the two men symbolized as sacerdotal or as kingly personages,
between whom it invariably stands. It is to be found equally
figured upon the small bucket meant for religious rites,<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> as embroidered
upon the upper sleeve of the monarch’s tunic.<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> From Fergusson’s
“Palaces of Nineveh, and Persepolis restored,” we learn that it was
frequently to be found sculptured as an architectural ornament. When
seen done in needlework upon dresses, the two animals&mdash;sometimes
winged bulls, sometimes gazelles&mdash;which its umbel of seven flowers is
separating, are shown with bended knees, as if in worship of it. Always
this plant is represented as a shrub, sometimes bearing a series of umbels
with seven flowers sprouting, each at the end of a tangled bough;
sometimes as a stunted tree with branches growing all the way up right
out of a thick trunk with ovated leaves; but the height never looks
beyond that of a good sized man. Never for one moment can it be
taken as any conventionalism for a tree, since it is as distinct an imitation
of a particular plant, as is the figure of the palm which occurs along
with it. To us, it has every look of belonging to the family of
Asclepiadeæ, or one of its near kindred.</p>

<p>The few Parsees still to be found in East India, are the only followers
of Persia’s olden religious practices; and in his “Essays on the sacred
writings, language, and religion of the Parsees,” Haug tells us,<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> that
those people yet hold a certain plant&mdash;the Homa, or hom?&mdash;to be sacred,
and from it squeeze a juice to be used by them in their religious services.
To our seeming, those buckets in the left hand of many an Assyrian
figure were for holding this same liquor.</p>

<p>Can the “hom” of the old Persians be the same as the famous Sidral
Almuntaha which bears as many leaves inscribed with names as there
are men living on the earth? At each birth a fresh leaf bearing the
name of the newly born bursts out, and, when any one has reached the
end of his life, the leaf withers and falls off.<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_clix">[Pg clix]</span></p>

<p>Though unable to identify among the plants of Asia, which was the
“hom” or tree of life, held so sacred by the Assyrians and later Persians,
we know enough about that king of fruits&mdash;the “pine-apple”&mdash;as to
correct a great mistake into which those have fallen who hitherto have
had to write about the patterns figured on ancient or mediæval textiles.
In their descriptions, we are perpetually told of the pine-apple appearing
there; and at a period when the Ananas, so far from having been even
once beheld in the old world, had never been dreamed of. Among the
Peruvians our pine-apple, the “Nanas,” was first found and seen by
Europeans. Hardly more than two hundred years ago was a single
fruit of it brought to any place in the old world. A little over a century
has it been cultivated here in England; and, as far as our memory goes,
a pine-apple, fifty years ago, had never been planted in any part of Italy
or Sicily, nor so much as seen. Writing, October 17, 1716, from
Blankenburg, and telling her friend all about a royal dinner at which she
had just been, Lady Mary Wortley Montague says:&mdash;“What I thought
worth all the rest (were) two ripe Ananasses, which, to my taste, are a
fruit perfectly delicious. You know they are naturally the growth of
Brazil, and I could not imagine how they came here, but by enchantment.
Upon enquiry, I learned that they have brought their stoves to
such perfection, &amp;c. I am surprised we do not practise in England so
useful an invention.”<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> As turnips grow in England, so do artichokes all
over middle and south Italy, as well as Sicily, large fields are full of them.
Put side by side with the pine-apple, and its narrow stiff leaves, the
artichoke in bloom amid its graceful foliage, shows well; and every
artistic eye will see that the Sicilian weaver, so fond of flowers and
nice foliage for his patterns, must have chosen his own vegetable, unfolding
its beauties to him at every step he took, and not a fruit of which
he had never heard, and which he had never looked upon.</p>

<p>In his description of fruits or flowers woven on a textile, let not the
youthful or unwary writer be led astray by older men with a reputation
howsoever high for learning other than botanical. Some years ago we
were reading with great delight a tale about some things that happened in
the third century, and near Carthage. Though avowedly a fiction, most
of its incidents were facts, so admirably put together that they seemed
to have been drawn by the pen of one who had lived upon the spot.
But taking one of his personages to a walk amid the hills running down
to the shores of North Africa, the writer leads him through a narrow
glen tangled over head, and shaded with sweet smelling creepers and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_clx">[Pg clx]</span>
climbers, among which he sees the passion-flower in full bloom. Now,
as every species&mdash;save one from China of late introduction&mdash;that we have
of this genus of plants, came to the old world from the new one, to
speak of them as growing wild in Africa, quite fourteen hundred years
before they could have been seen there, and America was known, is
spoiling a picture otherwise beautifully sketched.</p>

<p>With some, there perhaps may be a wish to know what was the
origin of this collection.</p>

<p>As is set forth, in the “Church of Our Fathers,”<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> some thirty
years ago there began to grow up, amid a few, a strong desire to behold
a better taste in the building of churches, and the design of every ecclesiastical
accessory. Our common sympathies on all these points brought
together the late Mr. A. Welby Pugin, and him who writes these lines,
and they became warm friends. What were the results to Pugin
through our intercourse he himself has acknowledged in his “Principles
of Pointed or Christian Architecture,” p. 67. To think of anything
and do it, were, with Pugin, two consecutive actions which followed
one another speedily. While at Birmingham Hardman was working in
metal, after drawings by Pugin, and putting together a stained-glass
window from one of his cartoons, a loom at Manchester, which had
been geared after his idea, was throwing off textiles for church use, and
orphreys, broad and narrow, were being wove in London: the mediæval
court at Hyde Park, in the year 1851, was the gem of our first
Exhibition. Going back, a German lady took from England a cope
made of the textiles that had been designed by Pugin. This vestment
got into the hands of Dr. Bock, whose feelings were, as they still are,
akin to our own in a love for all the beauties of the mediæval period.
While so glad of his new gift, it set this worthy canon of Aix-la-Chapelle
thinking that other and better patterns were to be seen upon
stuffs of an old and good period, could they be but found. He gave
himself to the search, and took along with him, over the length and
breadth of Europe, that energy and speed for which he is so conspicuous;
and the gatherings from his many journeys, put together, made up the
bulk of a most curious and valuable collection&mdash;the only one of its kind&mdash;which
has found an abiding home in England, at the South Kensington
Museum. Thus have these beautiful art-works of the loom become,
after a manner, a recompense most gratefully received, to the native
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_clxi">[Pg clxi]</span>
land of those men whose action, some thirty years ago, indirectly originated
their being brought together.</p>

<p>Before laying down his pen, the writer of this Catalogue must put on
record his grateful remembrances of the kindness shown so readily by
M. Octave Delepierre, Secretary of Legation and Consul-General for
Belgium, in rendering those inscriptions of old German upon that
curious piece of hanging, No. <a href="#h-1297">1297</a>, p. 296, as well as upon another
piece of the same kind, No. <a href="#h-1465">1465</a>, p. 298. For the like help afforded
about the same, together with those several long inscriptions upon No.
<a href="#h-4456">4456</a>, p. 92, the writer is equally indebted to Dr. Appell; and, without
the ready courtesy of the Rev. Eugene Popoff, the writer could not have
been able to have given the Greek readings, hidden under Cyrillian
characters, worked by the needle all around the Ruthenic Sindon, No.

<p>Sprawling all in gold and lively colours, both before and behind,
upon this rich garment of state, is figured, with all its hideousness, the
imperial five-clawed dragon, before which, according to the royal fancies

Chasuble</span> of crimson velvet, with both orphreys
embroidered; the velvet, pile upon pile, and figured

other smaller flowers in green and white; the orphreys figured
with the Apostles and the Annunciation. Florentine, late 15th
century. 4 feet 3½ inches by 2 feet 5½ inches.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Like most other chasubles, this has been narrowed, at no late period,
across the shoulders. The velvet is very soft and rich, and of that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
peculiar kind that shows a double pile or the pattern in velvet upon
velvet, now so seldom to be found. On the back orphrey, which is
quite straight, is shown St. Peter with his keys; St. Paul with a sword;
St. John blessing with one hand, and holding a chalice, out of which
comes a serpent, in the other; St. James with a pilgrim’s hat and staff:
on the front orphrey the Annunciation, and St. Simon holding a club,
but his person so placed, that, by separating the archangel Gabriel from the
Blessed Virgin Mary, a tau-cross is made upon the breast; St. Bartholomew
with a knife, and St. James the Less with the fuller’s bat. For
their greater part, the Gothic niches in which these figures stand, are
loom-wrought; but these personages themselves are done on separate
pieces of fine canvas and are applied over spaces left uncovered for
them. Another curious thing is that in these applied figures the golden
parts of the draperies are woven, and the spaces for the heads and hands
left bare to be filled in by hand; and most exquisitely are they wrought,
for some of them are truly beautiful as works of art.</p>

Cope</span>, crimson velvet, with hood and orphrey embroidered,
&amp;c. Florentine, late 15th century. 9 feet

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This fine cope is of the same set a part of which was the beautiful
chasuble <a href="#h-78">No. 78</a>, and, while made of precisely the same costly
materials, is wrought with equal care and art. Its large fine hood is
figured with the coming down of the Holy Ghost upon the infant
Church, represented by the Blessed Virgin Mary amid the Apostles, and
not merely this subject itself, but the crimson colour of the velvet would
lead us to think that the whole set of vestments was intended for use
on Witsunday. On the orphrey, on the right hand, the first saint is
St. John the Baptist, with the Holy Lamb; then, Pope St. Gregory
the Great; afterwards, an archbishop, may be St. Antoninus; after
him a layman-saint with an arrow, and seemingly clad in armour,
perhaps St. Sebastian; on the left side, St. George with banner and
shield; under him St. Jerome, below whom, a bishop; and lowermost
of all St. Onuphrius, hermit, holding in one hand a cross on a staff, in
the other a walkingstick, and quite naked, saving his loins, round which
he wears a wreath of leaves. All these subjects are admirably treated,
and the heads done with the delicacy and truth of miniatures.</p>

<p>This is one of the best preserved and the most beautiful works of the

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The rich crimson velvet is Genoese; the frame, an art-work of the
Milan school, is figured with two monsters’ heads, and two medallions,
one containing a naked youth seated, the other a nude female figure
standing. On the front of the bag are applied two embroideries in gold
and coloured silk, one an owl’s head, the other that of a full-faced
grotesque satyr; on the back is another satyr’s side-face. At one
time, such bags or ornamental purses, under the name of “gibecières” in
France and England, but known in Italy as “borsa,” were articles of

“Quentin Durward.” The expressions, in English of “cut-purse,” in
Italian “taglia borse,” for a pickpocket, are well illustrated by this gay
personal appendage.</p>

Chasuble</span> of green silk, figured with animals and
scrolls in gold, with an embroidered orphrey at back,
and a plain orphrey in front. Sicilian, early 13th
century. 3 feet 9¾ inches by 2 feet 2 inches.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This very valuable chasuble is very important for the beauty of its
stuff; but by no means to be taken as a sample in width of the fine old
majestic garment of that name, as it has been sadly cut down from its
former large shape, and that, too, at no very distant period. Though now
almost blue, its original colour was green. The warp is cotton, the woof
silk, and that somewhat sparingly put in; the design showing heraldic
animals, amid gracefully twining branches all in gold and woven, is remarkably
good and free. The front piece is closely resembling the back,
but, on a near and keen examination, may be found to differ in its
design from the part behind; on this we see that it must have consisted
of a lioncel passant gardant, langued, and a griffin; on that on the part
in front, a lioncel passant, and a lioncel passant regardant. When the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
chasuble was in its first old fulness, the design on both parts came out
in all its minuteness; now, it is so broken as not to be discernible at
first. In front the orphrey is very narrow, and of a sort of open lace-work
in green and gold; on the back the orphrey is very broad, 1 foot
1½ inches, and figured with the Crucifixion, the Blessed Virgin Mary
standing on our Lord’s right hand, St. John the Evangelist on His left;
below, the Blessed Virgin Mary crowned as a queen and seated on a
royal throne, with our Lord as a child sitting on her lap; lower still,
St. Peter with two keys&mdash;one silver, the other gold&mdash;in his left hand,
and a book in the right; and St. Paul holding a drawn sword in his
right, and a book in his left; and, last of all, the stoning of St. Stephen.
All the subjects are large, and within quatrefoils; as much of the body
of our Lord as is uncovered on the Cross, and the heads, hands, and
feet in the other figures, as well as those parts of the draperies not gold,
are wrought by needle, while the golden garments of the personages are
woven in the loom.</p>

<p>This very interesting chasuble has a history belonging to it, given
in “The Gentleman’s Magazine,” t. lvi. pp. 298, 473, 584, by which
we are taught to believe that it has always been in England; belonging
once to it were a stole and maniple, upon which latter appliance were
four armorial shields, which would lead to the idea that it had been expressly
made for the chapel of Margaret de Clare, Countess of Cornwall,
who is known to have been alive <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1294. That time quite tallies
with the style of the stuff of which this chasuble is made; and though
now so worn and cut away, it is one of the most curious in this or any
other country, and particularly valuable to an English collection.</p>

Piece</span> of the Bayeux Tapestry; ground, white linen;
design, two narrow bands in green edged with crimson
(now much faded) with a very thin undulating scroll
in faded crimson, and green between them. English, 11th
century. 3¼ inches by 2½ inches.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Though done in worsted, and such a tiny fragment of that great but
debated historical work, it is so far a valuable specimen as it shows the
sort of material as well as style and form of stitch in which the whole
was wrought. In the “Vetusta Monimenta,” published by the Society
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
of Antiquaries, plate 17, shows, in large, a portion of this embroidery
where the piece before us is figured; and, from the writing under it,
we learn that it was brought away from Bayeux by Mrs. Stothard, when
her husband was occupied in making drawings of that interesting record.
There is not the slightest reason for believing that this embroidery was
the work of Matilda, or any of her ladies of honour, or waiting maids;
but all the probabilities are that it was done by English hands, may be
in London by order, and at the cost, of one or other of three knights
from Bayeux, who came over with William, on whom he bestowed
much land in England, as we have already shown in the Introduction
to this Catalogue, § 4.</p>

<p>A fine specimen, in every respect, of Chinese manufacture; the satin
itself is of the finest, softest kind; whether we look at the green or the

Few European dyers could give those tints.</p>

<p>In its present form this piece constituted an article to be found, and
even yet seen, in very many families in Italy, Germany, and France,
and was employed for christening occasions, when the nurse or midwife
wore it over her shoulders, like a mantle, for muffling up the new-born
babe, as she carried it, in state, to church for baptism. In this, as in
other specimens of the Museum, there was a running string at top by
which it might be drawn tight to the neck. Those who have lived
abroad for even a short time must have observed how the nurse took
care to let a little of this sort of scarf hang out of the carriage-window
as she rode with baby to church. The christening cloth or cloak was,
not long since, in use among ourselves.</p>

impossible not to admire the skilful way in which the whole of the piece
before us is executed. In the female figures there seems to be much
truthfulness with regard to the costume and manners of that country;
and the sharp talon-like length of finger-nails affected by the ladies
there is conspicuously shown in almost every hand. The birds, the
insects, the flowers are all admirably done; and the tones of colour are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
so soft and well assorted, and there is such a thorough Chinese taste displayed
in the choice of tints&mdash;tints almost unknown to European dyers&mdash;that

itself is almost entirely well raised.</p>

on to a lining of strong canvas, having the cord only stitched

kettle-drums, other drums, knights’ tilting-lances, halberts, swords,
cannon, trumpets, all gracefully heaped together and upholding a
herald’s tabard blazoned with a leopard rampant, by the side of which,
and drooping above, are two flags, one showing the three fleurs-de-lis of
France, and the other with a charge that is indistinct; and the whole is
surmounted by a full-faced barred helmet wreathed with a ducal coronet,
out of which arises a plume of ostrich feathers; on the other sides are
two elegantly-shaped vases full of flowers. At each of the four corners
of this inner square is the monogram A. M. V. P. T. between boughs,
and surmounted by a ducal coronet; and at every corner of the border

Orphreys</span> for a Chasuble; ground, crimson silk;
design, an angel-choir in two rows amid wreaths, of
which the flowers are silver and the leaves gold, some
shaded green; on the back orphrey are two heraldic bearings.
German, very late 15th century.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This beautifully-wrought specimen of Rhenish needlework, most
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>likely done at Cologne, consists of twenty-six small figures of winged
angels robed in various liturgical vestments, and playing musical instruments
of all sorts&mdash;some wind, some stringed. Of these celestial beings
several wear copes over their white albs; others have over their albs
narrow stoles, in some instances crossed upon the breast as priests, but
mostly belt-wise as deacons: other some are arrayed in the sub-deacon’s
tunicle, and the deacon’s dalmatic: thus vested they hold the instrument
which each is playing; and no one but a German would have thought
of putting into angels’ hands such a thing as the long coarse aurochs’
horn wherewith to breathe out heavenly music. On the front orphrey
are ten of such angels; on the one made in the shape of a cross, for the back
of the chasuble, there are sixteen. At both ends of the short beam or
transom of this cross we find admirably-executed armorial bearings.
The first blazon&mdash;that to the left&mdash;shows a shield <i>gules</i> an inescutcheon
<i>argent</i>, over all an escarbuncle of eight rays <i>or</i>, for <span class="smcap">Cleves</span>; dimidiated
by, <i>or</i> a fess checky <i>argent</i> and <i>gules</i>, for <span class="smcap">Marck</span>; surmounted by a
helmet <i>argent</i> crested with a buffalo’s head cabosed <i>gules</i>, having the
shut-down bars of the helmet’s vizor thrust out through the mouth of
the animal, which is crowned ducally <i>or</i> the attire <i>argent</i> passing up
within the crown; and the mantlings <i>gules</i>. As if for supporters, this
shield has holding it two angels, one in a tunicle, the other in a cope.
The second shield&mdash;that on the right hand,&mdash;shows <i>gules</i> an inescutcheon
<i>argent</i>, over all, an escarbuncle of eight rays <i>or</i>, crested and supported as
the one to the left, thus giving, undimidiated, the blazon of the then
sovereign ducal house of <span class="smcap">Cleves</span>.</p>

<p>All these ornaments, armorial bearings, angels, flowers, and foliage,
are not worked into, but wrought each piece separately, and afterwards
sewed on the crimson silk ground, which is the original one; they are
“cut work.” The angels’ figures are beautifully done, and their
liturgic garments richly formed in gold, as are the leaves and stems of
the wreaths bearing large silver flowers. From its heraldry we may
fairly assume that the chasuble, from which these handsome orphreys
were stripped, belonged to the domestic chapel in the palace of the
Dukes of Cleves, and had been made for one of those sovereigns whose
wife was of the then princely stirring house of De la Marck.</p>

<p>As was observed, while describing the beautiful Syon Cope, <a href="#h-9182">No. 9182</a>,
the nine choirs of angels separated into three hierarchies is indicated
here also; and the distinction marked by the garments which they are
made to wear in these embroideries; some are clothed in copes, others
in tunicles, the remainder, besides their narrow stoles, in long-flowing
white albs only&mdash;that emblem of spotless holiness in which all of them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
are garmented, as with a robe of light. The bushiness of the auburn
hair on all of them is remarkable, and done in little locks of silk.</p>

<p>For a student of mediæval music, this angel-choir will have an
especial interest; but, to our thinking, neither this, nor any other production
of the subject, whether wrought in sculpture, painting, or
needlework, hitherto found out on the Continent, at all comes up in
beauty, gracefulness, or value, to our own lovely minstrel-gallery in
Exeter Cathedral, or the far more splendid and truly noble angel-choir
sculptured in the spandrils of the triforium arches in the matchless
presbytery at Lincoln Minster. A cast of the Exeter minstrel-gallery
is put up here on the western wall of the north court, and among the
casts lent by the Architectural Society are those of the angels in
Lincoln.</p>

<p>Of the musical instruments themselves, we see several in these two
pieces of cut-work. Beginning with the back orphrey, marked No. 1194
at top, the first of the two angels is playing with the fingers of both
hands an instrument now indiscernible; the second, the lute; below
them one is beating a tabour with a stick; the other is turning the
handle of the gita, our hurdy-gurdy. After these we have an angel
blowing a short horn, while his fellow angel strikes the psaltery. Then
an angel robed as a deacon in alb, and stole worn like a belt falling
from his right shoulder to under his left arm, sounding the sistrum or
Jew’s harp, and his companion fingers with his right hand a one-stringed
instrument or ancient monochord. In the last couple, one with a large
bow is playing the viol, a long narrow instrument with several silver
strings.</p>

<p>On the orphrey,&mdash;made in the shape of a cross and worn on the
back of the chasuble, <a href="#h-1194">No. 1195</a>,&mdash;the first angel plays the pan-pipes; the
second, a gittern, or the modern guitar; the next two show one angel,
as a deacon in dalmatic, jingling an instrument which he holds by two
straps, hung all round with little round ball-like bells; and his companion,
robed in alb and stole crossed at the breast like a priest, ringing
two large hand-bells; lower down, of the two angels both vested as
deacons, one blowing a large, long curved-horn, like that of the aurochs,
the other, the shalmes or double-reeded pipe. Below these, one in alb
and stole, belt-wise as a deacon, blows a cornamuse or bag-pipe; the
other, as deacon, the aurochs’ horn. Then a deacon angel has a trumpet;
his fellow, a priest in alb and crossed stole, is playing a triangle; last of
all, one plays a tabour, the other the monochord. So noteworthy are
these admirable embroideries, that they merit particular attention.</p>

<p>Another of those specimens of weaving in small looms worked by

to the crimson silk ground. The design of the narrow part has all along
its length, at its two edges, a pair of very small lines, now brown,
enclosing a dented ornament. As a liturgical appliance, this stole, for its
perfect state of preservation, is valuable; Dr. Bock says that a stole
called St. Bernhard’s, now in the church of our Lady at Treves, as well
as another curious one in the former cathedral at Aschaffenburg, are
in length and breadth, just like this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In all probability this orphrey belonged to the back of a chasuble,
and, as such, the subjects figured in it would find an appropriate place
there; but it ought to be observed that, in reality, it is made up of four
portions, the two narrow bands, besides the long and the short lengths
of the middle or broad parts which they border. At top we have the
Crucifixion, wherein each of our Lord’s feet is fastened by its own
separate nail. On one side of His head is the sun, on the other the moon;
St. Mary and St. John are standing on the ground beside Him; and, at
the cross’s foot, looks out a head, that of Adam, which, whether from
accident or design, has very much the shape of a lion’s with a shaggy
mane; one of the symbols belonging to our Lord is a lion, in token of
the resurrection. Some way down a female, crowned and wimpled,
bears in both her hands, which are muffled in a veil, a golden-covered
cup,&mdash;very likely Mary Magdalen, with her vessel full of costly spikenard
for anointing our Saviour’s feet against the day of His burying. Opposite
to her is St. Michael, spearing Satan, an emblem of the great
atonement, as is shown under <a href="#h-9182">No. 9182</a>, while describing the Syon Cope.
Lower down we have the three women or, as they are sometimes called,
Maries, with their sweet spices, and the angel telling them of the uprising
of our Redeemer. Lower yet, our Lord’s Ascension is represented
by showing Him seated in majesty with both His arms outstretched,
within an almond-shaped glory. On the second or shorter length, and,
as far as the Gospel history is concerned, out of its due place, we behold
the Annunciation, and a little under that subject a row of four nimbed
and seemingly winged heads, like those of the cherubim, may be symbols
of the four evangelists. At each side of these subjects runs a border of
gold wrought with lions crowned, and imaginary winged monster-animals
separated by graceful floriations; and on one of these borders, at the
lower end, is worked this inscription&mdash;“Odilia me fecit,” in nicely
shaped letters. This female name was common in Auvergne, where
St. Odilo, the sixth abbot of Cluni, was born, a son of the noble house of
Mercœur, and, to our thinking, it is very likely this Odilia was a
daughter of one of the lords of that once great family in the South of
France.</p>

<p>So worn away is this curious orphrey that often the several subjects
figured on in the loom, and not by the needle, can be hardly made out
till held in various lights.</p>

<p>This very handsome piece is another specimen of the small loom
worked by young women, as before noticed; and may have served either
for sacred or secular use. The band is parted into spaces by a thin
chevron, and each division so made is filled in with tiny but gracefully-twined
boughs, among which some times we have a pair of birds, at
others a pair of collared dogs; at top another arrangement took place,
but no more of it remains than the body of a lion.</p>

<p>The figure of our Redeemer, wrought upon linen with white silk,
much of which is worn away, is holding His wounded hands cross-wise,
and a scourge under each arm. From His brows, wreathed with thorns,
trickle long drops of blood; and the whole, with the large bleeding gaping
wound in His side, strikingly reminds us of the wood-cut to be found at
the beginning of our Salisbury Grails, or choir-books, with those anthems
sung at high mass, called graduals. In England such representations
were usually known under the name of “S. Gregory’s Pity,” as may
be seen in “The Church of our Fathers,” t. i. p. 53. This embroidery

<p>Both with regard to its golden cloth, and the figures upon it, this
piece is very valuable. The stuff is of that kind which our countryman,
John Garland, tells us was wrought by young women at his time,
and shows, in its grounding, a pretty zig-zag pattern. The two kneeling
figures, though done in mere outline of the scantiest sort, display an ease
and gracefulness peculiar to the sculpture and illuminations in England
and France of that period. St. Blase is shown us vested in his chasuble
and mitre&mdash;low in form&mdash;with a very long grey beard, and holding a
comb in one hand&mdash;the instrument of his martyrdom; St. Stephen is
robed as a deacon, and kneeling amid a shower of large round stones,
pelted at him on all sides.</p>

Sicilian, 14th century. 12 inches by 7½ inches.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The whole of this pattern is thrown off with great freedom, and an
heraldic eye will see the boldness of the griffins. The vine-leaves are
as crispy as any ever seen upon such stuffs, and the whole does credit to
the royal looms of Palermo, where it was probably wrought at the
command of the prince, for himself, or as a gift to some French royalty.
An exactly similar stuff to this may be found at No. 7061; and it is said
that the robes now shown at Neuburg, near Vienna, are traditionally
believed to have been worn, at his marriage, by Leopold the Holy.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Though such a mere rag, this piece is so far valuable, as it shows

are two giraffes, with one leg raised&mdash;may be better described as tripping.
They are specked all over with quatrefoil spots, and have head and hoofs
done in gold, now faded to black. This stuff is as beautiful in design
as substantial in its material, being all of good fine silk; though so poor

<p>The last four pieces are, in fact, but fragments of the same stuff,
and when put together make up its original pattern, and beautiful it
must have seemed when beheld as a whole; the bird and animals are
done with much freedom and spirit; so likewise the foliage: but two
of the portions, by being more exposed to the light, are much faded,
in such a manner that the green in them has almost fled. As usual, so
poor was the golden thread that the bird and animals now look almost
black, but here and there, with a good glass, shimmerings of gold may be
found upon them. To some eyes the sun may look like a rose surrounded
by rays. At one time or another an unfeeling hand has most plentifully
sprinkled all these four pieces with flowers made from gilt paper stamped
out, and pasted on the staff with stiff glue. The silk, especially the
yellow, of this tissue was mixed with very fine threads of cotton.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The design in all its elements is so like many other specimens wrought
by the looms of Palermo at the period, that we are warranted to presume
it came from that great mart of silken stuffs during the middle ages. So
thin in its texture, it must have been meant for the lining of a heavier
material. Père Martin has figured, in his very valuable “Mélanges
d’Archéologie,” t. iv. plate xxii, a piece of silk, now in the Museum of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
the Louvre, almost the same in pattern, but differing much in colour,
from the specimen before us. In the specimen at Paris little dogs and
dragons, both in pairs, come in, but here they are wanting; so that we
may learn that, to give variety to the pattern, parts were changed.
Upon the shield there is a charge not unlike a star, rather oblong,
of six points.</p>

short sentences of imitated Arabic here and there. Sicilian,
early 14th century. 14 inches by 11 inches.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This is a fine and noteworthy production of the Palermitan loom,
and shows in its pattern much fancy and great freedom of drawing; for
whether we look at those very singular griffin elephants, sitting in pairs&mdash;and
gazing at one another, or the two birds of the hoopoe family,
with a long feather on the head, or the two gold wings conjoined
and erect, so heraldically tricked, with that well-devised flower ending
in a honeysuckle scroll, an ornament sprinkled all about, we cannot but
be pleased with the whole arrangement. The combination of elephant
and griffin in ornamentation is almost, perhaps quite, unique. The
pretended Arabic points to a locality where once Saracenic workmen
laboured, and left behind them their traditions of excellency of handicraft.

Embroidery</span> of Thread upon Linen; design, in
raised stitchery, the hunting of the unicorn. German,
late 14th century. 26½ inches by 13½ inches.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This fine piece of needlework shows us a forest where a groom is
holding three horses, on two of which the high-peaked saddles are well
given; running towards him are two hunting dogs, collared. In the
midst of the wood sits a virgin with her long hair falling down her back,
and on her lap an unicorn is resting his fore-feet; behind this group is
coming a man with a stick upon his shoulder, from which hangs, by its
coupled hind-legs, a dead hare. Not only the lady, but the men wear
shoes with remarkably long toes, and the gracefulness with which the
foliage is everywhere twined speaks of the period as marked in the
architectural decoration of the period here in England. In another
number (<a href="#h-8618">8618</a>) the same subject is noticed as significative of the
Incarnation, and fully explained. No doubt, like the other piece of
fine Rhenish needlework, this also formed but a part of a large cloth to
hang behind an altar as a reredos. Those very long-toed shoes brought
into fashion here by Ann of Bohemia, our Richard II.’s queen, were
called “cracowes.”</p>

Silk</span> and Gold Damask; ground, deep violet; design,
St. Mary of Egypt, with her own hair falling all over
her, as her only garment, on her knees before an altar
on which stands a cross; behind her, a tree, upon which hovers
a bird with a long bough in its beak; and high up over against
her an arm coming from a cloud with the hand in benediction,
and rays darting from the fingers, between two stars, one of
eight, the other of six points, all mostly in gold. Venetian,
15th century. 12 inches by 11½ inches.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The materials and the weaving of this valuable tissue are both good,
and figure a saint once in great repute in Oriental Christendom as
well as among those Europeans who traded with the East, as an example
of true repentance. A part of the design is, so to say, ante-dated, and
to understand the whole of it we ought to know something of the life of
this second Magdalen.</p>

<p>In the latter half of the fourth century St. Mary of Egypt, then a
girl of twelve, fled to Alexandria, where she led an abandoned life.</p>

<p>It chanced that she went in a certain ship full of pilgrims to Jerusalem,
where, on the feast of the Elevation of the Cross, she was hindered
by a miracle from entering the church. Then, coming to herself, she
made a vow of penance, and withdrew to the desert beyond the Jordan.
There she lived unseen for forty years, till all her garments fell away
and she had nothing wherewith to clothe herself but her own long
hair.</p>

<p>On the stuff before us the anachronism of its design will be soon
perceived from this rapid sketch of St. Mary’s life. Instead of being,
as she must have been, arrayed in the female fashion of the time when
she went to Jerusalem, the great penitent is represented so far quite
naked that her own long tresses, falling all around her, are her only
mantle&mdash;just as she used to be more than forty years afterwards. But
yet the design well unfolds her story; the hand darting rays of light
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
signifies the revelation given her from heaven, and the blessing that followed
it; while the two stars tell of Jerusalem, as also does the elaborately-fashioned
cross that is standing on the altar, the frontal to
which, in the upper border, seems ornamented in purple, with an
inscription, now unreadable, but the last letters of which look as if they
are R L I. The bird, perhaps a dove, has no part in the saint’s history,
but is a fancy of the artist. In Dr. Bock’s “Geschichte der Liturgischen
Gewänder des Mittelalters,” 1 Band, 1 Lieferung, pl. xi. is a
figure of this stuff.</p>

<p>These scarce examples of Oriental ability in the production of very
thin substances for personal adornment and dress, under such a sun as
even the north of Africa has, were originally wrought for ordinary, not
religious use. They were brought to Europe as precious stuffs, and
given as such to the Church and used for casting over the tombs of the
saints, as palls, or as linings for thicker silken vestments. That these
or any of the following specimens of gauze or taffeta were ever put
to the purpose of making stockings, or rather leggings like boots, still
worn by bishops on solemn occasions during the celebrations of the
liturgy, cannot for a moment be thought of. Such appliances are, and
always were, made either of velvet or strong cloth of gold or silver.</p>

worked with white doves in pairs, and a green tree blooming with red
flowers; and though much of the needlework is gone, this cushion is a

<p>The design of this orphrey-web is good, but the gold so amalgamated
with copper that it has become quite brown. Though the monogram
is that usually seen in the hands of St. Bernardinus of Sienna, and the
drawing of the group of the Blessed Virgin Mary and the sacred Child
is somewhat Italian, this was not the work of any Italians loom; for
in no part of Italy would the monogram have had given it letters of such
a German type.</p>

<p>That the last liturgic use of this piece was as an apparel to an alb

black, it was once gilt, like those strips we see cut into very narrow
shreds, and worked up, instead of gold thread, into silken stuffs from the
looms of Almeria or Granada, specimens of which are in this collection.

was done in that great German city. By wear, the greens of the leaves
have turned brown, and the pink of the flowers become pale. Those

embattled; 2nd, three turreted towers, two and one. Seemingly this
piece of Flemish napery was made for some nobleman whose wife was,
or claimed to be, of the ancient blood of the royal house of Castile.</p>

a head composed of three trefoil arches in a straight line, and
resting on trefoil-brackets, and having, all through, birds and
flowers in the spandrils. French, late 14th century. 7 feet
11 inches by 3 feet 4 inches.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Though now so rough and tattered this almost unique piece of “cut-work”
(which French people would call appliqué, but better described
by the English words), of so large a size, is valuable for its use in
showing how, with cheap materials and a little knowledge of drawing,
a very pleasing, not to say useful, article of decoration may be made,
either for church appliance or household furniture.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the heads of the personages in the upper row are
all cut away, but lower down we plainly see the history meant to
be represented. Upon the first pane, to the left, we have a regal
throne, upon which are sitting, evidently in earnest talk, a king,
crowned and sceptred, and a knight, each belted with a splendid
military girdle falling low down around the hips. Behind the knight
stands his ’squire. In the next pane the enthroned king is giving his
orders to the standing knight, toward whom his ’squire is bringing
his sword, his shield, (<i>argent</i> a fess <i>azure</i>, surmounted by a demi-ox
<i>azure</i>,) and a bascinet mantled and crested with the head of the same
demi-ox or aurochs and its tall horns. After this we behold the knight
with lance and shield, and his ’squire on horseback riding forth from
the castle, at the gate of which stands the king, outstretching his
hand and bidding farewell to the knight, who is turning about to
acknowledge the good-bye. Going first upon the road, the knight, followed
by the ’squire, seems asking the way to the dragon’s lair, from
a gentleman whom they meet. The monster is then found in a
wood, and the knight is tilting his spear into its fire-red maw. The
next pane carrying on the romance is the first to the left in the second
or lower series. Here the knight is unhorsed, and his good grey steed
is lying on the field; but the knight himself, wielding his sword in both
hands, is about to smite the dragon breathing long flames of fire towards
him. Afterwards he catches hold of his fiery tongue, and is cutting it
off. It would look as if the dragon, though wounded to the loss of its
tongue, had not been worsted; for in the following compartment we
behold the same knight all unarmed, but well mounted, galloping forth
from a castle gate with a hound and some sort of bird, both with strings
to them, by his horse’s side, and having found the dragon again,
appears holding an argument with the beast that, for answer, shows
the fiery stump of his tongue in his gaping mouth. But the dragon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
will not give himself up and be led away captive. Now, however,
comes the grand fight. In a forest, with a bird perched on high upon
one of the trees, the knight, dismounted from his horse, cuts off the
head of the dragon, which, to the last, is careful to show his much
shortened yet still fiery tongue to his victor. Now have we the last passage
but one in the story. Upon his bended knee the triumphant knight is
presenting the open-mouthed, tongueless, cut-off dragon’s head to the
king and queen, both throned and royally arrayed, the princess, their
daughter, standing by her mother’s side. The young maiden, no
doubt, is the victor’s prize; but now&mdash;and it is the last chapter&mdash;the
knight and lady, dressed in the weeds of daily life and walking forth
upon the flowery turf, seem happy with one another as man and wife.
The two panes at this part, and serving as a border, seem out of place,
and neither has a connection with the other; in the first, just outside a
castle wall, rides a crowned king followed by a horseman, evidently of
low degree; and a column separates him from a large bed, lying upon
which we observe the upper part of a female figure, the head resting
upon a rich cushion; next to this, but put in anglewise to fill up the
space, we have a crowned lady and a girdled knight, sitting beneath a
tree, each with a little dog beside them.</p>

<p>The costume of both men and women in this curious piece of cut-work
is that of the end of the 14th century. The parti-coloured dress
of the men, their long pointed shoes, and the broad girdles, worn so low
upon their hips by the king and knight, as well as the bascinet and
helmet of the latter, with the horses’ trappings, all speak of that period;
nor should we forget the sort of peaked head-dress, as well as the way
in which the front hair of the ladies is thrown up into thick short curls.
All the human figures, all the beasts, as well as the architecture, are
outlined in thin leather or parchment once gilt, but now turned quite
black. With the same leather, too, were studded the belts of the
king and knight, and the spangles and golden enrichments of the ladies’
dress were of the same material. Saving here and there a few stitches
of silk, everything else was of worsted, and that none of the finest
texture. With such small means a good art-work was produced, as we
see before us. The way in which each figure over the whole of this
curious piece of cut-work is outlined by the leather edging strongly
reminds us of the leadings in stained glass; in fact, both the one and
the other are wrought after the same manner, and the principal difference
between the window and the woollen hanging is the employment
of an opaque instead of a transparent material. If the personages
are dressed sometimes in blue, at others in crimson, it will be found that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
these colours alternate with the alternating tints of the panes upon
which they are sewed.</p>

<p>So often do the passages in the romance here figured correspond with
certain parts in the wild legend of our own far-famed “Sir Guy of
Warwick,” that, at first sight, one might be led to think that as his
renowned story was carried all through Christendom, we had before us
his mighty feats and triumph over the dragon in Northumberland, set
forth in this handiwork of some lady-reader of his story.</p>

<p>This chasuble must have been truly grand and majestic when new,

is figured with the crucifixion, done after a large and effective manner,
for the person of our Redeemer measures more than 1 foot 9 inches
in length, and His, as well as all the other faces are thrown up in low
relief. At the ends of the transom of the cross are four winged angels&mdash;two
at each side, of whom one is catching, in a golden chalice, the
sacred blood spirting from the wounds in the hands, the other flying
down in sorrow from the clouds. High above the cross are two angels
with peacock-feather wings, swinging two golden thuribles, which are
in low relief; and between these angelic spirits, a golden eagle in high
relief, with wings displayed, armed and beaked <i>gules</i> and holding in
his once crimson talons a scroll which, from the letters observable,
may have been inscribed with the motto, “(Respice) in fi(nem).” The
front of the chasuble is made of a piece of velvet of another and much
broader design&mdash;a large flower of five petals and two stipulæ&mdash;but
equally remarkable for its deep mellow ruby tone and soft deep pile.
Its orphrey of fine diapered gold-thread embroidery, but much worn
away through being long rubbed by its wearers against the altar, is
worked with the Blessed Virgin Mary carrying in her arms our Saviour,
as a naked child, caressing His mother’s face; and, lower down, with a
female figure crowned and nimbed, bearing in her right hand a golden
chalice, at the top of which is a large eucharistic particle marked with
a cross-crosslet; this is the emblem of the Church. Both figures are
large and of a telling effect; and, like the other figures, have more
of a naturalistic than ideal type of beauty about them.</p>

looks like a tree, may be an ornament traditionally handed down from
the times when the Persian sacred “hom” was usual in the patterns
of that country. No great antiquity can be claimed by the textile
before us.</p>

Mitre;</span> crimson and gold velvet. Florentine, 15th
century. 1 foot 10½ inches by 11 inches.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This liturgical curiosity is of that low graceful shape which we
find in most mitres before the 16th century; in all probability this
one was made not for real episcopal use, but to be employed in the
service of the so-called boy-bishop who used, for centuries, to be chosen
every year from among the boys who served in the cathedral, or the
great churches of towns, at Christmas-tide, as well in England as all
over Christendom; (see “Church of our Fathers,” t. iv. p. 215). As
the rubrical colour for episcopal mitres is white, or of cloth of gold, a
crimson mitre is of great rarity. The one before us is made of those
rich stuffs for which Florence was so famous, as may be instanced in
the gorgeous vestments given to Westminster Abbey by our Henry VII.
The mitre itself is of crimson velvet, freckled with gold threads,
raised in a rich pile upon a golden ground, with green fringed lappets;
but the “titulus,” or upright stripe before and behind, along with the
“corona,” or circular band, are all of a kind of lace or woven texture
of raised velvet, green, white, and crimson, after a pretty design,
upon a golden ground. The mitre is lined throughout with light-blue
silk.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The satin is poor, and its colour faded; but the embroidery, with
which it is plentifully overspread, is of a rich, though not tasty, kind.
Birds of extraordinary, and, no doubt, fanciful plumage are everywhere
flitting about it, among flowers as unusual as themselves; but the
glowing tones of the many-coloured silks in which they are wrought
must strike every one’s eye. From the double-headed eagle, done in
gold, with wings blue, yellow, and green, displayed, it would appear
that this quilt was wrought for some (perhaps imperial) house in
Europe.</p>

<p>By a very modern hand the words “King Charles” are written

There is much about the shape of the cap itself, and especially in the

fashioned by a German hand, and for German and not English use.
In a piece of tapestry once belonging to the famous Bayard, and now
in the Imperial Library at Paris, the same form of high-crowned crimson
velvet cap is worn by Pyrrhus while he is being knighted, as may be
seen, plate 42, in Shaw’s “Dresses and Decorations of the Middle

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Though the needlework upon this chasuble is effective at a distance,
like much of the embroidery of the time, both in this country and
abroad, it is found to be very rude and coarse when seen near. The style
of the whole ornamentation is so very English that there is no mistaking
it. The back orphrey is in the shape of a cross; and on it, and figured
at top, Melchisedek with three loaves in his hand; beneath him, the
prophet Malachi, on the left of whom we have Abraham with a large
broad sacrificial knife in his hand, on the right, King David and his
harp; these three form the transom of the cross. Going downward, we
see St. John the Evangelist with the chalice; below this apostle, David
again; and, last of all, half the person of some saint. On the front
orphrey are given St. James the Greater, and two prophets of the Old
Law. This chasuble, with its stole and maniple, is said to have been
found at Bath, hidden behind the wainscot of a house there. Certain it
is that the chasuble has been much cut down. The original size was
far larger.</p>

surrounded by angels, while she drops her girdle to St. Thomas as he
kneels at her late grave, now filled with new-blown lilies, and bearing
on its front the words “Assunta est.” “Assunta” for “Assumpta”

Piece</span> of Needlework figured with a female saint at her

<div class="blockquot">

<p>By the costume this work would seem to have been done in Tuscany,
and it shows the bed-room of some saintly noble dame, wimpled and
clad in a crimson mantle embroidered with gold. At the foot of her
bed there is, wrought and diapered in gold, a praying desk on which lies
open a book in silver having a large M in red marked on its first page;
above is a picture of our Redeemer, known by His crossed glory, in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
act of giving His blessing, before whom the saint is praying. At her
knees are two green snakes, and above her two angels are carrying her
soul, under her human form, up to heaven. Behind her, and close to
a belfry, where the bells are swinging and the ropes of which are hanging
down, is a group of men, one a tonsured cleric, seemingly, from his
dalmatic, a deacon, with both hands upraised in surprise; near him
other clerics tonsured, two of whom are reading with amazement out of
a book held by a noble layman. This work contains allusions to several
events in the life of St. Frances, widow, known in Italy, as Santa
Francesca Romana; but a very remarkable one is here especially
sketched forth. She is said to have often beheld the presence of her
guardian angel, clothed as a deacon, watching over her. Such was
the obedience and condescension yielded by her to her husband that,
though wrapped in prayer, or busied in any spiritual exercise, if called
by him or anywise needed by the lowliest servant in her family, she
hastened to obey at the moment. It is told of her, that one day,
being asked for as many as four times in succession, just as she was,
each time, beginning the same verse again, of a psalm in the Office of
the Blessed Virgin, on coming back for the fifth time she found that
verse written all in gold. Here then we have the loving husband
showing this prayer-book, with its golden letters, to a crowd of friends,
among whom is his wife’s angel hidden under a deacon’s dalmatic;
while the saint herself is at her devotions, foreseeing in vision the evils
that are to befall Italy, through civil strife, shown by those serpents and
the swinging bells betokening alarm and fright.</p>

two bars (perhaps) <i>sable</i> charged, the upper one with three, the lower
with one, bezants or plates; and last of all, upon the other border, <i>or</i>,
a lion rampant, <i>gules</i> with chief vair, <i>sable</i>, and <i>or</i>. Repeated at various

half-dove, sipping out of the vessel; and below this group another,
consisting of two stags well “attired,” each with one hoof upon the
brim of a fountain out of which they are about to drink. This latter
symbol is evidently a reference to the Psalmist’s hart that panteth after
the fountains of water, while the former one is a representation of the
union of the serpent’s wisdom with the simplicity of the dove. In many
ancient monuments the upper half of the bird is that of a dove, the
lower ends in a snake-like shape with an eye shown at the extremity
of the tail. There are five long rhythmical inscriptions on this cloth,

are very poor, and run nearly as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“When one wrote the year Fifteen hundred and Eighty five, the
noble and true Henry von Geispitzheim had chosen for his spouse the
virtuous Anna Blickin von Lichtenberg. Both of them were of ancient
noble descent. And she, to honour the esquire, her husband, wished to
adorn and increase the house furniture, and there has worked with her
own hand this and still many other pretty cloths, to her memory.
Praying that God may preserve the esquire, and the tender children, and
herself also, and that they may pay the debt of nature at the end of a
long life, and eternal joy may be granted them.</p>

<p>“Now follows here my own birthday. When one wrote 1552 my
mother’s heart was gladdened by my first cry. In the year 1585 I gave
birth myself to a daughter. Her name is Emilia Catharina, and she has
been a proper and praiseworthy child. Two years later, in a cold
January, has God again gratified me with a daughter tender and fine,
she drinks water and no wine, her name is Magdalena Elizabeth. In
1588 my son Richard came into this world, whose birth gave great
pleasure to his father. In the following year, in February, I gave birth
to my twins, Hans Caspar and Emich (Erich?). At last, in 1593, on
the 12th of February, my daughter Anna Margaretha was born.&mdash;O
you truly beloved children, I commend myself to your memory. Do
not forget your prayers in the morning. And be temperate in your
pleasures. And make yourselves acquainted with the Word of God.
Then God will preserve you, and will grant you happiness and bliss.”</p>

<p>“This, O my dear children, has at my wish been put into rhymes,
in order that you may know your age by this work of my own hand,
which I leave to you as a memorial. I beseech you to be sincere in all
matters; that will make you great and glorious. Honour everybody
according to his station; it will make you honourably known. You,
my truly beloved sons, beware of fiery wine, and drink with moderation;
that will preserve you from evil. And you, my truly beloved daughters,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
let me recommend you to be virtuous. Preserve and guard your honour;
and reflect before you do anything; for many have been led into evil
by acting first and reflecting afterwards. The way to get to this end is
the fear of God, mark me well! The fear of God brings wisdom and
understanding. The fear of God makes rich, and gives joy and courage,
refreshes life and blood. The fear of God protects us from all evil;
and is the way to the state of bliss. The fear of God is the foundation
on which the happiness of man rests; and is the chief way to all virtues.
He who seeks it in his youth will live with honour till his old age; and
his happiness will daily increase.</p>

<p>“Amen. Give to God all honour.”</p>

the first of April after midnight, just at one o’clock&mdash;often I think of
it&mdash;my truly beloved husband, the Squire Henry von Geispitzheim, was

age was sixty and eight years. The dropsy has killed him. To him
grant, O God! Thy mercy, after Thy will. I, his afflicted Anna

<p>“On the fifth of August soon afterwards another sorrowful event
happened. My youngest son Eimah (Erich?), one of my twins, suddenly
departed from this world; and therefore my sorrow was increased,
and all hope overthrown. O God! have mercy upon me, and come to
comfort and help me, poor one. Help, true God! and assist me, comfort
me with Thy Spirit, and protect me and my dear children who are still
left in good health. And grant, O God! that we then may behold
Thee in Heaven eternally. O Lord! forgive us our trespasses, help that
we may wait with patience until our last hour may come; and also that
our faith may be true, to believe in Thy Word steadfastly until we sink
into the slumber of death.”</p>

Table-cover</span> of white linen, figured in thread, with
the “Agnus Dei,” or “Holy Lamb,” in the middle,
and the symbolic animals of the four Evangelists, one
at each corner. German, late 16th century. 6 feet 3 inches
by 5 feet 8 inches.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>For its sort and time there is nothing superior to this fine piece of
needlework. About the evangelic emblems, as well as the Lamb in
the centre, there is a freedom and boldness of design only equalled by
the beauty and nicety of execution, making the piece altogether quite
an art-work. The little dogs chasing the young harts, as well as the
rampant unicorns, but especially the bird of the stork-kind preening its
feathers, and the stag looking back at the hound behind, all so admirably
placed amid the branches so gracefully twining over the whole field,
show a master’s spirited hand in their design. Unfortunately, however,
none of its beauty can be seen unless, like a piece of stained glass, it be
hung up to the light. Its use was most likely liturgic, and occasions for
it not unfrequently occur in the year’s ritual round; and on Candlemas-day
and Palm Sunday it might becomingly have been spread over the
temporary table on the south side of the altar, upon which were put,
for the especial occasion, the tapers for the one service, and the palm-branches
for the other, during the ceremony of blessing them before
their distribution.</p>

Linen</span> Napkin; the four corners embroidered in crimson

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The design consists of a stag at rest couchant, and an imaginary
figure, half a winged human form, half a two-legged serpent, separated
by a flower of the centaurea kind. This is repeated on the other side
of the square, up the middle of which runs an ornamentation made out
of a love-knot, surmounted by a heart, sprouting out of which is a stalk
bearing a four-petaled flower, and then a stem with the usual corn-flower
at the end of it. To all appearance, this linen napkin was for
household use.</p>

holding our Lord in her arms, and, at her feet, a youthful virgin-saint,
most likely St. Catherine of Sienna. From the cross itself flowers are
in some places sprouting out, and three angels are catching, in chalices,
the sacred blood that is gushing from the wounds on the body of our
Lord. At each corner is an evangelist’s symbol, and the whole is
framed in a broad border in crimson and white silk, edged by crochet-work,
and at the corners are the letters A. H. A. R. Though the
figures are in mere outline they are well designed, but poorly, feebly
executed by the needle. Another specimen of a cradle-quilt, much
like this, is <a href="#h-1344">No. 1344</a>, and under No. 4644 notice is taken of feeling for
the employment of the four Evangelists’ symbols at the corners of this
nursery furniture.</p>

Altar-frontal;</span> embroidered in the middle with

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This frontal is said to have been brought from Orvieto; but in
it there is nothing about the celebrated relic kept in the very beautiful
and splendid shrine in that fine cathedral. So very worn is this
piece of embroidery, that several panels of it are quite indistinct. It
may be, however, distinguished into three parts&mdash;the centre and the
two sides. In the first we have, in nine compartments, the Annunciation,
the Nativity, the coming of the Wise Men, the Blessed Virgin
Mary, with St. Joseph, going to the temple and carrying in a basket
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
her pair of turtle-doves, which she is giving to Simeon; the Last
Supper; our Lord being taken in the garden; the Crucifixion; the burial;
the Resurrection of our Saviour; on the right side, the legend of St.
Christopher, mixed up with that of St. Julian Hospitaler; on the left
are passages from the life of St. Ubaldo, bishop of Gubbio in the
middle of the 12th century. In the first square is the saint mildly forgiving
the master-mason who carried the new walls of the city across a
vineyard belonging to St. Ubaldo, and, when reproved about the wrong
thus done to private property, knocked down the saint; in the second
we behold the saint at the bedside of a converted sinner, whose soul,
just breathed forth, an angel is about to waft to heaven; in the
third we have before us the saint himself, upon his dying bed, surrounded
by friends, one of whom&mdash;a lady&mdash;is throwing up both her
arms in great affright at the sudden appearance of a possessed man
who has cast himself upon his knees at the bedfoot, and, with one hand
outstretched upon the bed, is freed from the evil spirit, which is flying
off over head in shape of a devil-imp; in the last the saint is being
drawn in an open bier, by two oxen, to church for burial, followed by a
crowd, among whom is his deacon.</p>

<p>From the subjects on this much-decayed frontal, figured, as it is,
with the life of St. Ubaldo, known for his love of the poor, his kindness
to wayfarers and pilgrims, and his healing of the sick, as well as with
the legends of St. Julian and St. Christopher, remarkable for the same
virtues, we may infer that this ecclesiastical appliance hung at the altar
of some poor house or hospital, in by-gone days, at Orvieto.</p>

barry of six <i>argent</i> and <i>azure</i>, with mantlings about a helmet closed and

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This piece, though much resembling the foregoing, <a href="#h-5665">No. 5665</a>, is
far below it as an art-work, and, by its style, betrays itself as the production
of another period. Within a wreath, the Annunciation is
figured, after the usual manner, but without gracefulness, in the middle
of the cloth; at one corner Winter is shown, by men in a yard chopping
up and stacking wood; then, by the inside of a room where a woman
is warming herself before one of those large blind stoves still found in
Germany, and a bearded man, seated in a large chair, doing the same
at a brazier near his feet, while outside the house a couple are riding
on a sledge drawn by a gaily caparisoned horse. At the corner opposite
we have Spring&mdash;a farm-house, with its beehives, and a dame coming
out with a jug of milk to a woman who is churning, near whom is
a hedger at his work, and other men pruning, grafting, and sowing.
For Summer, two gentlemen are snaring birds with a net; a woman
and a man, each with a sickle in hand, are in a cornfield; two people
are bathing in a duck-pond before a farm-house, on the roof of which
is a nest with two storks sitting, one of which has caught a snake;
and in a meadow hard by a man is mowing and a woman making
hay. For Autumn, we see a vineyard where one man is gathering
grapes and another carrying them in a long basket on his shoulders;
and near, a man with a nimb, or glory, about his head, and lying on
the ground with one leg outstretched, which a dog is licking above
the thigh&mdash;perhaps the shepherd St. Rock, and, while a gentleman is
walking past behind him, a girl, with a basket of fruit upon her head,
is coming towards the spot. Between the seasons, and within circular
garlands, are subjects akin to these parts of the year; in a boat, upon
the water, a young couple are beginning the voyage of life together;
a lady on a grey horse is, with hawk on hand, disporting herself in the
flowery fields; a young lady is caressing a lamb with one hand and
carries a basket of young birds in the other; last of all, another lady is
kneeling at her prayers, with a book open before her on a table over-spread
with a nicely worked cloth. A deep gold fringe runs all round
the four sides of this table-cover.</p>

A</span> figure of St. Mark, seated; embroidered, in part

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Beneath a circular-headed niche, with all its accessories in the style
of the revival of classic architecture, sits St. Mark, known as such by the
lions at his side. Within his right arm the Evangelist holds a large
cross; and on his lap lies an open book, both pages of which are written
with the words:&mdash;“Gloria in excelsis Deo, et in tēa.” Much of the
architecture, as well as of the drapery of this personage, is loom-wrought,
assisted in places by needle-embroidery. The head, the hands, the feet,
are all done by the needle; but the head, neck, and beard are worked
upon very fine linen by themselves, and afterwards applied, and in such
a manner that the long white beard overlaps the tunic. His chair, instead
of legs, is upheld upon the backs of two lions lying on the ground.
The head is done with all the fineness and delicacy of a miniature on
ivory, and the way in which the massive folds of his full wide garments
are thrown over his knees is noteworthy and majestic.</p>

Box</span> for keeping the linen corporals used at mass, in
the vestry. It is covered with fine linen, of a creamy
brown tint, embroidered with crimson silk and gold.
Inside it is lined, in part green, on the lid crimson, where a very
rude print of the Crucifixion, daubed with colour, has been let in.
German, 17th century. 8½ inches by 7½ inches, 1¾ inches deep.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Such boxes seem to have been much used, at one time, throughout
Germany, for keeping, after service, the blessed pieces of square fine
linen called corporals, and upon which, at mass, the host and chalice
are placed.</p>

<p>Before being employed all the year round as the daily repository for
laying up the corporals after the morning’s masses, this sacred appliance,
overlaid with such rich embroidery, and fitly ornamented with the
illumination of the Crucifixion inside its lid, would seem to have been
originally made and especially set aside for an use assigned it by those
ancient rubrics, which we have noticed in our Introduction, § 5.
As such, it is, like No. 8327 further on, a great liturgical rarity,
now seldom to be found anywhere, and merits a place among other
such curious objects which give a value to this collection.</p>

<p>At the mass on Maundy Thursday, besides the host received by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>officiating priest, another host is and always has been consecrated by
him for the morrow’s (Good Friday’s) celebration; and because no
consecration of the Holy Eucharist, either in the Latin or in the Greek
part of the Church, ever did nor does take place on Good Friday,
the service on that day is by the West called the “Mass of the Pre-sanctified,”
by the East, “Λειτουργία τῶν προηγιασμενῶν.”</p>

<p>Folded up in a corporal (a square piece of fine linen), the additional
host consecrated on Maunday Thursday was put into this receptacle or
“capsula corporalium” of the old rubrics, and afterwards carried in
solemn procession to its temporary resting-place, known in England as
the sepulchre, and there, amid many lights, flowers, and costly hangings
of silk and palls of gold and silver tissue, was watched by the people the
rest of that afternoon, and all the following night, till the morning of the
next day, when, with another solemn procession, it was borne back to
the high altar for the Good Friday’s celebration.</p>

<p>This piece may have been part of a frieze, round the head of a

an artistic cheat, pretending to be either wrought in the loom or

free, and the touches of the pencil effective. To this day stencil ornamentation
upon house-walls is very much employed in Italy, where
papering for rooms is seldom used even as yet, and not long ago was
in many places almost unknown.</p>

<p>The quatrefoils are linked together by a kind of fretty knot, as well

one, all of which looks very like Florentine work. Most likely
this orphrey served for the side of a cope.</p>

Silk</span> Damask; ground, crimson silk; pattern, in gold
thread, two very large lions, and two pairs, one of very
small birds, the other of equally small dragons, and an
ornament like a hand looking-glass. Oriental, 14th century.
2 feet 4 inches by 2 feet.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The large lions, which strongly resemble, in their fore-legs, the
Nineveh ones in the British Museum, are placed addorsed regardant and
looking upon two very small birds, while between their heads stands
what seems like a looking-glass, upon a stem or handle; at the feet of
these huge beasts are two little long-tailed, open-mouthed, two-legged
dragons. The whole of this design now appears to be in coarse yellow
thread, which once was covered with gold, but so sparingly and with
such poor metal that not a speck of it can now be detected anywhere
in this large specimen. The probability is that this stuff was wrought in
some part of Syria, for the European market; at the lions’ necks are
broad collars bearing two lines or sentences in imitated Arabic characters.
Copes and chasubles for church use during the Middle Ages were often
made of silks like this. Dr. Bock has figured this very piece in his
“Geschichte der Liturgischen Gewänder des Mittelalters,” t. i. pl. iv.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This is one among the known early productions of the loom, and
therefore very valuable. The lion and man seem to be meant for
Samson’s victory over that animal, though, for the sake of a pattern, the
same two figures are repeated in such a way that they are in pairs and confronted.
Samson’s dress is after the classic form, and he wears sandals,
while a long narrow green scarf, fringed yellow, flutters from off his
shoulder behind him; and the tawny lion’s mane is shown to fall in
white and black locks, but in such a way that, at first sight, the black
shading might be mistaken for the letters of some word. This stuff is
figured by Dr. Bock in his “Geschichte der Liturgischen Gewänder

<p>Though poor in material this silk is so far interesting as it gives a
link in that long chain of traditional feeling for showing the cross about
stuffs, meant, as most likely this was, for ritual uses, and known among

custom is followed in the East of having the cross marked upon

Pedro the Cruel, at the battle of Navaretta, or Najarra, if not having a
significance of the marriage of Catherine of Arragon, first with our
Prince Arthur, eldest son of Henry VII, and after his death, with
his younger brother, Henry VIII, each of whom was in his time Prince
of Wales, whose badge became one or more ostrich feathers. In old
English church inventories drawn up towards the middle and the end
of the 15th century, mention is often found of vestments made of a
Flemish stuff, called Dorneck, from the name in Flanders for the city
of Tournay, where it was made, but spelt in English various ways, as
Darnec, Darnak, Darnick, and even Darnep. Such an inferior kind of
tissue woven of thin silk mixed with wool and linen thread, was in great
demand, for every-day wear in poor churches in this country. Though
not wrought at Tournay, the present specimen affords a good example
of that sort of stuff called Dorneck, which, very probably, was introduced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
into Flanders from Spain. Besides the present textile, another,
figured in the “Mélanges d’Archéologie,” t. iii. pt. xxxiii, furnishes an
additional instance in which the ostrich feather is brought into the
design.</p>

Chasuble,</span> in crimson velvet, with orphreys embroidered
in gold and coloured silks. Florentine, 15th

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This garment has been much cut down, and so worn that, in parts,
its rich and curious orphreys are so damaged as to be unintelligible.
Over the breast and on the front orphrey is embroidered the Crucifixion,
but after a somewhat unusual manner, inasmuch as, besides our Lord on
the Cross, with His mother and St. John the Evangelist standing by;
two other saints are introduced, St. Jerome on one side, St. Lucy on
the other, kneeling on the ground at the foot of the Cross, possibly the
patrons, one of the lady, the other of the gentleman, at whose cost this
vestment was wrought. Under this is St. Christina defending Christianity
against the heathens; her arraignment, for her belief, before one of
Dioclesian’s officials; her body bound naked, and scourged at a pillar.
On the back orphrey, the same martyr on her knees by the side of
another governor, her own pagan father, and praying that the idol, held
to her for worship by him, may be broken; the saint maintaining her
faith to those who came to argue with her before the window of the prison,
wherein she is shut up naked in a cauldron, with flames under it, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
praying with one of the men who are feeding the fire with bundles of
wood, on his knees, as if converted by her words; then, the saint standing
at a table, around which are three men; and below all, a piece so worn
and cut, as to be unintelligible. Upon the last square but one is a shield
<i>argent</i>, a bend <i>azure</i>, charged with a crescent <i>or</i>, two stars <i>or</i>, and
another crescent <i>or</i>, probably the blazon of the Pandolfini family, to whose
domestic chapel at Florence this vestment is said to have belonged.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The velvet is of a rich pile, and the tone of colour warm. The
orphreys, or rather apparels, are all of the same texture, woven of a red
ground, and figured in gold with cherubic heads, having white faces;
the lace also is red, and gold; but in both the gold is quite faded. The
sleeves are somewhat short, but the garment itself is full and majestic.
Doubtless the dalmatic and tunicle formed a part of a full set of vestments,
to which the fine and curiously embroidered chasuble, <a href="#h-7788">No. 7788</a>,
belonged; and their apparels, or square orphreys, above and below, before

his sword, wearing a green tunic, and a blue mantle sprinkled with trefoils
in red and gold, perhaps meant for fleurs-de-lis, seems to be intended
for St. Louis of France. The broad green silk fringe, and the pointed
shape of the hood will not escape notice; and behind may yet be seen
the eyes by which this hood was hung upon the cope. The poor
shabby silver tinsel round this king is an addition quite modern.</p>

crimson velvet, and in coloured silks and gold thread, done in

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In many respects these two apparels, seemingly for the lower adornment
of the liturgical alb, one before, the other behind, are very valuable;
besides the subjects they represent, they afford illustrations of the style
of needlework, architecture, costume, and heraldry of their time.</p>

<p>In the upper apparel, we have the birth and childhood of the mother
of our Lord, as it is found in one of the apocryphal books of the New
Testament, entitled,&mdash;“Evangelium de Nativitate S. Mariae,” which
the Latins got from the Greeks, as early, it would seem, as the second
or third age of the Church. Though of no authority, this book was in
especial favour with our countrymen, and it was not unfrequently noticed
in their writings; hence, no doubt, the upper apparel was suggested
by that pseudo-gospel. In its first compartment, we behold a middle-aged
lady, richly clad, having a mantle of gold, lined with vair or costly
fur, about her shoulders, seated on a cushioned stool with a lectern, or
reading-desk before her, and upon it an open book of the Psalms, with
the beginning of the fiftieth written on its silver pages,&mdash;“Miserere
mei, Deus,” &amp;c., and outstretching her hands towards an angel coming
down from the clouds, and as he hails her with one hand, holds, unrolled,
before her eyes, a scroll bearing these words:&mdash;“Occurre viro
ad portam.” This female is Ann, wife of Joachim, and mother of
Mary; and the whole is thus set forth in the Codex Apocryphus Novi
Testamenti; where the angel, who appeared to her while she was at
prayer, is said to have spoken these words:&mdash;“Ne timeas, Anna, neque
phantasma esse putes.... Itaque surge, ascende Hierusalem, et cum
perveneris ad portam quæ aurea, pro eo quod deaurata est, vocatur, ibi
pro signo virum tuum obvium habebis,” &amp;c.&mdash;<i>Evangelium de Nativitate
S. Mariae</i>, c. iv. in <span class="smcap">Cod. Apocry.</span> ed. Thilo, pp. 324, 325. This
passage is thus rendered in that rare old English black-letter book of
sermons called “The Festival,” which was so often printed by Caxton,
Wynkyn de Worde, and other early printers in London:&mdash;“Anne was
sory and prayed to God and sayde, Lorde, that me is woo. I am
bareyne, and I may have noo frute ... and I knowe not whyther he
(Joachim my husband) is gone. Lorde have mercy on me. Whene as
she prayed thus an angell come downe and comforted her, and sayd:
Anne, be of gode comfort, for thou shalt have a childe in thyne olde
age, there was never none lyke, ne never shall be ... and whan he
(Joachim) come nye home, the angell come to Anne, and bade her goo
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
to the gate that was called the golden gate, and abide her husbonde
there tyll he come. Thene was she glad ... and went to the gate and
there she mete with Joachim, and sayd, Lord, I thanke thee, for I was
a wedow and now I am a wyfe, I was bareyne and now I shall bear a
childe ... and whan she (the child) was borne, she was called
Mary.”&mdash;<i>The Festival</i>, fol. lxvi. In the second compartment we have a
further illustration of the foregoing text in the representation of the
golden gate at Jerusalem, and Anna and Joachim greeting one another as
they meet there. In the third, there is the lying-in of Anna, who from
her own bed is swathing her new-born child, whom the Almighty’s right
hand coming from heaven is blessing. In the fourth is Anna bringing
her little girl Mary, when three years old, as an offering to God, in the
temple, before the High Priest. In the fifth and last compartment of
this upper row of niches, we see Anna teaching her daughter, the B. V.
Mary, to read the Psalter. In the first compartment in the lower apparel,
or on the second row, the angel Gabriel, winged and barefoot, is represented
standing before the B. V. Mary, whom with his right he is
blessing, while in his left he holds out before her a scroll on which are
the words:&mdash;“Ave Maria gracia.” She outstretches her hands, and
gently bending her head forwards, seems to bow assent; between them is
the lily-pot, and, as it should, holds but one flower-stem, with three, and
only three, full-blown lilies (“Church of our Fathers,” t. iii. p. 247);
above, is the Holy Ghost, figured as a white dove, coming down upon
the Virgin. To this follows St. Elizabeth’s visit to the B. V. Mary,
or the Salutation, as it is often called in this country. Then we have
the Nativity, after the usual manner, with the ox and ass worshipping at
the crib wherein our Lord is lying in swaddling clothes; and St.
Joseph is figured wearing gloves. Filling the next niche, we behold
the angel coming from the skies, with a scroll in his hands inscribed,&mdash;“Gloria
in excelsis Deo,” to the shepherds, one of whom is playing on
a bag-pipe with one hand, as with the other he is ringing a bell, which
draws the attention of his dog that sits before him with upturned head
and gaping mouth. In the last compartment we have the three wise
men, clothed and crowned as kings, going to Bethlehem with their gifts,
but none of them is a negro. Of the two shields hung alternately between
every spandril, one is,&mdash;barry of ten <i>argent</i> and <i>gules</i>, which was
the blazon of Thornell de Suffolk; and the other,&mdash;<i>azure</i> three cinque-foils
<i>argent</i>, that of the family of Fitton, according to a MS. ordinary
of arms, drawn up by Robert Glover, some time Somerset herald. In
the subject of the shepherds, the ground is so plentifully sprinkled with
growing daisies, that it seems as if it were done on purpose to tell us
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
that she whose hands had wrought the work was called Margaret; as
the flower was in French designated “La Marguerite,” it became the
symbol of that saint’s name, and not unfrequently was the chosen emblem
of the females who bore it.</p>

Gold</span> Embroidery on purple silk over a white cotton
ground, with figures of our Saviour and of the apostles
St. Peter, St. Simon, and St. Philip. Sicilian work,
done about the end of the 12th century. 14½ inches by 7 inches.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This piece of needlework with its figures, as well as its architectural
accessories, wrought in gold thread, though rude in its execution, is not
without an interest. In it the liturgical student will find the half of an
apparel (for it has been unfeelingly cut in half at some remote time)
for the lower hem in front of the linen garment known as the alb.
Originally it must have consisted of seven figures; one of our Lord, in
the middle, sitting upon a throne in majesty with the Α on the one side
and the Ω on the other side of His nimbed head, and His right hand
uplifted in the act of bestowing His benediction. To the left must have
been three apostles; to the right are still to be seen the other three,
nearest our Saviour, St. Peter, holding in his left hand a double-warded
key, next to him St. Simon, with his right hand in the act of blessing,
and holding in his left a saw fashioned not like ours, but as that instrument
is still made in Italy, and last of all St. Philip, but without any
symbol. What look like half-moons with a little dot in the inside, and
having a cross between them, are nothing more than the word
“Sanctus,” thus contracted with the letter S written as the Greek
sigma formed like our C, a common practice in Italy during the middle
ages, as may be seen in the inscriptions given by writers on Palæography.</p>

<p>Our Lord is seated within an elongated trefoil, and, at each corner
at the outward sides, is shown one of His emblems, better known as
the Evangelists’ symbols hinted at by the prophet Ezekiel, i. 10:
of these, two are very discernible, the winged human bust, commonly
called St. Matthew’s emblem, at top, and the nimbed and winged horned
ox or calf for St. Luke. The Apostles all stand within round-headed
arches, the spandrils of which are filled in with a kind of diaper
ornamentation.</p>

Piece</span> of Purple Silk Embroidery in gold and silver;
pattern of interlaced dragons, human figures, and
birds. North German, 12th century. 8½ inches by
7¼ inches.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This small sample of needlework is as remarkable for the way in
which it is wrought, as for the wild Scandinavian mythology which is
figured on it.</p>

<p>The usual process for the application of gold and silver in textiles
and embroidery is to twine the precious metal about cotton thread, and
thus weave it in with the shuttle or stitch it on by the needle. Here,
however, the silver, in part white in its original condition, in part gilt,
is laid on in the form of a very thin but solid wire, unmixed with cotton,
and the effect is very rich and brilliant.</p>

<p>In the middle of this piece are shown two monsters interlacing one
another; within the upper coil which they make with their snake-like
lengths, stands a human figure which, from its dress, looks that of a
man who with each outstretched hand, seems fondling the serpent-heads
of these two monsters; that at the other end terminates in the upper
portion of an imaginary dragon with wings on its shoulders, its paws well
armed with claws, and a wolfish head largely horned, and jaws widely
yawning, as eager to swallow its prey. To our thinking, we have
shown to us here the Scandinavian personification of evil in the human
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
figure of the bad god Loki (the embroidery of whose face is worn away)
and his wicked offspring, the Midgard serpent, the wolf Fenrir, and
Hela or Death, who may be identified in that female figure seated
within the smaller lower coil made by the twining serpents. Amid
some leaf-bearing branches to the right is perceived a man as if running
away affrighted; to the left we behold Thor himself, mallet in hand,
about to deal a heavy blow upon the scaly length of this Midgard serpent.
About the same time this embroidery was worked the bishop’s
crozier began to end in the serpent’s head. A good figure of this piece
is given by Dr. Bock, in his “Geschichte der Liturgischen Gewänder
des Mittelalters,” 1 Band, 2 Lieferung, pt. vi.</p>

<p>Though of a very tame design and rather striking for the sparing
way in which the dim gold is rolled about its thread, still it is not fair to
judge of what this stuff might have once been when new, fresh from
the loom and unfaded. If, in the first half of the 12th century, silks
so wrought with the representation of fishes were deemed worthy of
being put into use for state garments of a German Emperor; a short
hundred years later, they were for their symbolism thought even more
fitting to be employed for making the chasubles and copes worn at
divine service in the cathedral of London. From the inventory drawn
up, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1295, of the altar vestments belonging to old St Paul’s, we learn
that among them there were:&mdash;“Capa magistri Johannis de S. Claro, de
quodam panno Tarsico, viridis coloris, cum plurimis piscibus et rosis de
aurifilo, contextis.” Dugdale’s “History of St. Paul’s,” new ed. p. 318.
“Item casula de panno Tarsico indici coloris cum pisculis et rosulis
aureis, &amp;c.” Ib. p. 323. In all likelihood, the fish here shown was meant
for what we oddly call “John Dory,” a corruption of the Italian
“Gianitore,” or gate-keeper, the name of this fish in some parts of
Italy, in reference to St. Peter, who is deemed to have found the tribute-money
in the mouth of this fish, hence denominated St. Peter’s fish.</p>

<p>It is said that an imperial tunic, now kept in the Maximilian
Museum at Munich, once belonged to the Emperor Henry II., and
was spoken of as such in a list of the treasures of Bamberg Cathedral
in the 12th century. From the border of this tunic the piece before us
is reported to have been cut off.</p>

<p>That in the 12th century Bamberg Cathedral had the imperial
(probably the coronation) tunic of its builder and great benefactor, and
as such reckoned it among its precious things, was but natural; it,
however, by no means follows that this is the garment now at Munich
and brought from Bamberg six hundred years after its reputed owner’s
death, and put into the museum in his palace by the Elector Maximilian,
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1607. Keeping in mind that the Emperor Henry II. was crowned
at the very beginning of the 11th century, about the year 1002, and
seeing in the piece before us the style of the end of the 12th century&mdash;with
thus a period of almost two hundred years between the two
epochs&mdash;we cannot recognize this specimen to have ever formed a
portion of the real tunic of the above-named German emperor. Besides
its style, its materials forbid us to accept it as such. Its design is set
forth in cording of a coarse thread roughly put together; the spaces
between are filled in with shreds of red silken gold tissue, and of gold
stuff sewed on to very coarse canvas. That, in this condition, it had
been much used, and needed mending through long wear, is evident from
other pieces of a gold and velvet texture of the 14th century being let
in here and there over the frayed portions, thus showing a second example
of what is called “applied.” Like Germany, England, too, has
made its mistakes on such matters, for we are told that “as the kings
of England are invested with the crown of St. Edward, their queens are
crowned with that of St. Edgitha, which is named in honour of the
Confessor’s consort.”&mdash;Taylor’s “Glory of Regality,” p. 63. In the
inventory, drawn up in the year 1649, “of that part of the Regalia
which are now removed from Westminster to the Tower Jewel
House,” we find entered “Queen Edith’s crowne, King Alfred’s
crowne,” &amp;c.&mdash;Taylor’s “Glory of Regality,” p. 313. The likelihood
is that, in the 17th century, these supposed Anglo-Saxon crowns
were not 200 years old.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Like the piece immediately preceding, this too comes to us with an
account that it once formed a part of the white silk imperial tunic
belonging to the same holy Emperor Henry II., and was cut off from
that garment now preserved in the Maximilian Museum in the royal
palace at Munich. That it could have been wrought so early as the
beginning of the 11th century, that is, about the year 1002, we are
hindered from believing by the style of the ornamentation of this very
rich stuff. As a specimen of the Arabic loom in the 13th century it is
most valuable, and looks as if its designer had in his mind Persian
traditions controlled by Arabic ideas while he drew its pattern. A
remembrance of the celebrated Persian <i>Hom</i>, or sacred tree, which
separates both the griffins, the leopards, and the birds&mdash;seemingly peacocks
in one place, long-tailed parrots in another&mdash;was clearly before
him. The griffins are addorsed regardant and sketched with spirit; so
too are the leopards, which are collared, and like the “papyonns,” or
present East Indian “cheetahs,” of which mention is made at No.
8288. Altogether this pattern, which is thrown off with so much
freedom, is among the most pleasing and effective in the collection, and
the thickness of its silken texture renders it remarkable.</p>

with the distinguishing adjunct of “holosericus,” or made entirely of
silk, and sometimes noticing it as “porphyreticum,” while enumerating

middle part of the earliest portion of the 14th century, embroidered
with so many fantastic figures; the lion passant with the human head,
at the left end, of the beginning of the 13th; and the green letter M,
poorly worked on the red garment laid bare at the right end by the loss
of the circular piece of embroidery once sewed on there, no doubt in
the style and of the same period of the human-faced lion, of the latter
part of the 15th century.</p>

<p>The whole of the middle piece is of needlework, and figured with
sixteen figures, four-legged beasts in the body, and human in the heads,
all of which are seen, by the hair, to be female. All are statant gardant
or standing and looking full in the face of the spectator. Eight
of them are playing musical instruments, most of which are stringed and
harp-shaped, one a clarionet-like pipe, another castanets, and two cymbals,
and are human down to the waist; the other eight seem meant for
queens wearing crowns, and having the hair very full, but reaching no
further than the shoulders, while the minstrel females show a long braid
of dark brown hair falling all down the back. The queens have wings,
and are human only in head and neck; the musical figures are wingless,
and human as far as the waist. All these monsters display large tails,
which end in an open-mouthed head like that of a fox, and are all
noued. Each of these figures stands within a square, which is studded
at each corner with the curious four-pointed love-knot, and in the
ornamentation of its sides the crescent is very conspicuous; besides
which, upon the bodies of these figures themselves numerous ring-like
spots are studiously marked, as if to show that the four-legged animal
was a leopard. Grotesques like those in this curious piece of embroidery
abound in the MSS. of the 14th century; and those cut in
stone on the north and south walls outside Adderbury Church, Oxon,
bear a strong likeness to them. These fictitious creatures, made up of
a woman, a leopard&mdash;the beast of prey, a fox&mdash;the emblem of craftiness
and sly cunning, wielding too the power of wealth and authority,
shown in those regal heads, and bringing those siren influences of
music, love, and revelry into action, lead to the belief that under such
imagery there was once hidden a symbolic meaning, which still remains
to be found out, and this embroidery may yield some help in such an
interesting study.</p>

<p>All the figures are wrought on fine canvas in gold thread, and
shaded with silk thread in various colours, the ground being filled in, in
short stitch, with a bright-toned crimson silk that has kept its colour
admirably. The narrow tape with a gold ornament upon a crimson
ground, that encloses the square at each end of this liturgical appliance,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
is very good, and perhaps of the 13th century, as well as the many-coloured
fringe of the 15th. There is no doubt this maniple, for such
it is, was made out of scraps of secular adornments of various dates; and
gives us remarkable examples of embroidery and weaving at various
periods. One end of it is figured in Dr. Bock’s “Geschichte der
Liturgischen Gewänder des Mittelalters,” 1 Band, 2 Lieferung,

Portion</span> of a Maniple, linen web with an interlaced

Byzantine. 1 foot 9 inches by 2¾ inches.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This curious remnant of textiles, wrought on purpose for liturgical
use, shows in places another combination of lines, or rather of a digamma,
so as to form a sort of cross: and stuffs so diapered were called by Greek,
and after them by Latin, Christian writers, “gammadia.” It was a
pattern taken up by the Sicilian and South Italian looms, whence it spread
so far north as England, where it may be found marked amid the ornaments
designed upon church vestments figured in many graven brasses.
From us it got the new name of “filfod” through the idea of “full foot,”
which by some English mediæval writers was looked upon as an heraldic
charge, and is now called “cramponnée.” During the 13th century,
in this country, ribbon-like textiles, for the express purpose of making
stoles and maniples to be worn at the altar, were extensively wrought,
and constituted one of the articles of trade in London, for a distinguished
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
citizen of hers, John de Garlandia, or Garland, tells us:&mdash;“De textis
vero fiunt cingula, et crinalia divitum mulierum et stole(ae) sacerdotum.”
These “priests’ stoles,” in all likelihood, were figured with the gammadion
or filfod pattern; and, perhaps, many of them which are to be
found in foreign sacristies to this day came from London.</p>

<p>The piece before us is figured in Dr. Bock’s “Geschichte der Liturgischen
Gewänder des Mittelalters,” 4 Lieferung, pt. iii. fig. 3.</p>

<p>That this curious and elaborate piece of bead embroidery must have
been part of an orphrey for a chasuble, and not a maniple, is evident
from the pointed shape in which it ends. From its style, and the
quantity of very small beads and bugles which we see upon it, it would
seem to have been wrought either at Venice itself, in some of its mainland
dependencies, or in Lower Styria. Then, as now, the Venetian
island of Murano wrought and carried on a large trade in beads of all
kinds; and the silversmith’s craft was in high repute at Venice. Finding,
then, this remnant of a liturgical vestment so plentifully adorned with
beads, bugles, and coral, besides being so dotted with little specks of gold,
and sprinkled with so many small but nicely worked silver-gilt stars, we
are warranted in taking this embroidery to have been wrought somewhere
in North East Italy or South West Germany, upon the borders of the
Adriatic. Those fond of ecclesiastical symbolism will look upon this old
piece of needlework with no small interest, and observe that it was by
intention that the ground was blue. It is figured in Dr. Bock’s
“Geschichte der Liturgischen Gewänder Mittelalters,” 1 Band, 2

<p>This fine costly specimen of old silken stuff cannot fail in drawing
to itself a particular attention from the heedful observer, by its gracefully
elaborate design, so well carried out and done in such rich materials, but
more especially by the symbols figured on it.</p>

<p>Though now unable to read or understand the meaning of all those
emblematic hints so indistinctly uttered in its curious border, made
up, as it is, of a wyvern, a stork embowed and statant on an elephant

day, the key to it all will be found; then, perhaps, the piece
before us, and many other such textiles in this very collection, may
turn out to be no little help to some future writer while unravelling
several entanglements in mediæval history.</p>

beasts and birds the slightest reference was intended to be made to the

A</span> SINDON or kind of Frontal, of Crimson Silk, on a

thread, with a large figure of our Lord dead, two
standing angels, and, at each of its four corners, a half-length<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
figure of an evangelist; the whole enclosed in a border inscribed
with Sclavonic characters. Ruthenic work, middle of 17th
century. 4 feet 6½ inches by 2 feet 10 inches.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the centre of this curious ecclesiastical embroidery (for spreading
outside the chancel, at the end of Holy Week, among the Greek,)
our dead Lord, with the usual inscription, IC, XC, over Him, is
figured lying full length, stretched out, as it were, upon a slab of
stone which a sheet overspreads. His arms are at His sides as far
as the elbows, where they bend so that His hands may be folded
downward cross-wise upon His stomach, from which, to His knees,
His loins are wrapped in a very full-folded cloth done in silver
thread, but now nearly black from age. His skin is quite white, His
hair and beard of a light brown colour, and His right side, His hands
and feet are marked each with a blood-red wound; and the embroidery
of His person is so managed as to display, in somewhat high relief, the
hollows and elevations of the body’s surface; all around and beneath
His head goes a nimbus marked inside with a cross very slightly pattee,
the whole nicely diapered and once bright silver, but now quite black.
Two nimbed angels, beardless and, in look, quite youthful, are standing,
one at His head, the other at His feet, each, like the other, vested, as is
the deacon at the present day, for mass, according to the Greek and
Oriental rites; they wear the “chitonion” or alb, over that the
“stoicharion” or dalmatic, and from the right&mdash;though it should have
been from the left&mdash;shoulder falls the “orarion” or stole, upon which
the Greek word “agios,” or holy, is repeated, just as a Greek deacon is
shown in “Hierurgia,” p. 345; in his right hand each holds extended
over our Lord, exactly as Greek deacons now do, at the altar, after the
consecration of the Holy Eucharist, a long wand, at the end of which
is a large round six-petaled flower-like ornament, having within it a
cherub’s six-winged face; this is the holy fan, concerning which see
the “Church of our Fathers,” iv. 197; and each has his left hand so
raised up under his chin as to seemingly afford a rest for it. At each
of the four corners of the frontal is the bust of an evangelist with a
nimb about his head; in the upper left, “Agios o Theologos,” for so
the Greeks still call St. John the Evangelist: in the lower left, St. Luke;
in the upper right, St. Matthew; in the lower right, St. Mark; each is
bearded, and the hair, whether on the head or chin, is shown in blue
and white as of an aged man. While the heads and faces of all four evangelists
are red, with the features distinguished by white lines, the angels
have white faces and their hair is deep red with strokes in white to indicate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
the curly wavings of their locks. There are two crosses, rather
pattee, done in silver thread, measuring 2½ inches, one above, the other
below our Lord, in the middle of the ground, which is crimson, and
wrought all over with gracefully twined flower-bearing branches; and
each evangelist is shut in by a quarter-circle border charmingly worked
with a wreath of leaves quite characteristic of our 13th century work.
All the draperies, inscriptions, and ornamentation, now looking so black,
were originally wrought in silver thread that is thus tarnished by age.</p>

<p>Among the liturgical rarities in this extensive and precious collection
of needlework, not the least is the present Russo-Greek “sindon,”
or ritual winding-sheet, used in a portion of the Eastern Church service
on the Great Friday and Great Saturday, as the Orientals call our
Good Friday and Holy Saturday.</p>

<p>The colour itself&mdash;purplish crimson&mdash;of the silk ground upon which
our Lord’s dead body lies, as it were, outstretched upon the winding-sheet
in the grave, is not without a symbolic meaning, for amongst the
Greeks, up to a late period, of such a tint were invariably the garments
and the stuffs employed on every occasion any wise connected with the
dead, though now, like the Latins, the Muscovites at least use black for
all such functions.</p>

<p>All around the four borders of this sindon are wrought in golden
thread, now much tarnished, sentences of Greek, but written, as the
practice is among the Sclaves, in the Cyrillian character, thus named
from St. Cyrill, the monk, who invented that alphabet a thousand years
ago, as one of the helps for himself and his brother St. Methodius, in
teaching Christianity to the many tribes of the widely-spread Sclavonian
people, as we noticed in our Introduction, § 5.</p>

<p>Beginning at the right-hand side, from that portion of the silk being
somewhat torn, the words are not quite whole, but those that can be
read, say thus:&mdash;“Pray for the servant of God, Nicolaus....and
his children. Amen;” here, no doubt, we have the donor’s
name, and the exact time itself of this pious gift was put down, but
owing to the stuff being, at this place too, worn away, the date is somewhat
obliterated, but seems to be the year 1645.</p>

<p>All the other sentences are borrowed from the Greek ritual-book
known as the Ὡρολόγιον or Horologium, in the service for the afternoon
on Good Friday and Holy Saturday. Along the lower border runs this
“troparion,” or versicle:&mdash; Ὁ εὐσχήμων Ἰωσὴφ ἀπὸ τοῦ ξύλου καθελὼν τὸ
ἄχραντόν σου Σῶμα, σινδόνι καθαρᾷ εἰλήσας καί ἀρώμασιν ἐν μνήματι καινῷ
κηδεύσας ἀπεθέτο. “The comely Joseph (of Arimathea) having taken
down from the wood (of the cross) the spotless body of Thee (O Jesus),
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
and having wrapped it up in a clean winding-sheet together with aromatics,
taking upon himself to afford it a becoming burial, laid it in a
new grave.” Upon the left hand side comes this versicle:&mdash; Ταῖς
μυρόφοροις γυναιξὶ παρὰ τὸ μνῆμα ἐπιστάς, ὁ Ἄγγελος ἐβόα: Τὰ μύρα τοῖς
θνητοῖς ὑπάρχει ἁρμόδια, Χριστὸς δὲ διαφθορᾶς ἐδείχθη ἀλλότριος&mdash;Τροπάρια τοῦ
Τριαδίου. Τῷ ἁγίῳ καὶ μεγάλῳ Σαββάτῳ. “Seeing at the grave the women
who were carrying perfumes, the Angel cried out, ‘The ointments fitting
(to be used in the burial) for mortal beings are lying here, but Christ,
having undergone death, has shown Himself (again) after another
form.’”</p>

<p>According to the rite followed by the Russians and Greeks, on the
afternoon of Good Friday, as well as that of Holy Saturday, a sindon or
liturgical winding-sheet, figured just like the one before us, is brought
into the middle of the church, and placed outside the sanctuary, so that
it may be easily venerated by all the people in turn. First come the
clergy, making, as they slowly advance, many low and solemn bows,
and bendings of the whole person. Reaching the sindon, each one
kisses with great devotion the forehead of our Lord, and the place of
the wounds in His side, His hands, and feet. Then follow the congregation,
every one approaching in the same reverential manner, and
going through the same ceremonial like the clergy; all this while are
being sung, along with other versicles, the ones embroidered round this
piece of needlework. But this is not all, at least in some provinces
where the Greek ritual obtains. As soon as it is dark on Good Friday
evening, upon a funeral bier is laid the figure of our Lord, either
wrought in low relief, painted on wood or canvas, or shown in needlework
like this sindon. Lifted up and borne forwards, it is surrounded
by a crowd carrying lights. Then follow the priests vested in chasubles
and the rest of the garments proper for mass; after them walk the
lower clergy, and the lay-folks of the place come last. Then the procession
goes all through and about the streets of the town, singing the
cxviiith Psalm, the “Beati immaculati in via,” &amp;c. of the Vulgate, or
cxixth of the authorized version, between each verse of which is chanted
a versicle from the Horologium. Everywhere the populace bow down
as the bier comes by, and many times it halts that they may kiss the
figure of our dead Saviour, whose image is overspread by the flowers
sprinkled upon it as it is carried past, and afterwards these same flowers
are eagerly sought for by the crowd, who set much store by them as the
bringers of health to their bodies and a blessing on their homesteads all
the after year. Now it should be observed that, even in the present
piece, what is the real sindon or white linen winding-sheet shown open</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>and spread out quite flat beneath our Lord’s body, is put upon a mourning
pall of red silk, which is worked all over with flowers, doubtless
in allusion to this very custom of showering down upon it flowers as it
is carried by.</p>

<p>Very like, in part, to the Greek ceremony, is the Latin rite still
followed on Good Friday of kissing the crucifix as it lies upon a cushion
on the steps going up to the altar, and known of old in England as
creeping to the cross, the ritual for which among the Anglo-Saxons, as
well as later, according to the use of Salisbury, may be seen in the
“Church of Our Fathers,” t. iv. pp. 88, 241. Those who have travelled
in the East, or in countries where the Greek rite is followed,
may have observed that, almost always, the cupola of the larger churches
is painted with the celebration of the Divine Liturgy; and among the
crowd of personages therein shown are usually six angels reverently
bearing one of these so-figured sindons, as was noticed in the Introduction,
§ 5.</p>

<p>Such napkins are very great liturgical curiosities, as the present one,
and another in this collection, are the only specimens known in this
country; and perhaps such another could not be found on any part of
the Continent, the employment of them having been for a very long time
everywhere left off. Its top, like a high circular-headed cap, 4¾ inches
by 4 inches, is marked with a diapering, on one side <i>lozengy</i>, on the
other <i>checky</i>, ground crimson, and filled in with the gammadion or filfot
in one form or another. On the lozenges this gammadion is parti-coloured,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
green, yellow, white, purple; in the checks, all green, yellow,
white, and purple. Curiously enough, the piece of vellum used as a
stiffening for this cap is a piece of an old manuscript about some loan,
and bears the date of the year 1256. The slit up the middle of the
linen, 11 inches long, is bordered on both edges with a linen woven
lace, 1½ inches broad, embroidered on one side of the slit with L, one
of the forms of the gammadion; on the other with the saltire, or St.
Andrew’s cross; the gammadion and saltire are wrought in purple,
green, crimson (faded), or yellow, each of one colour, and not mixed,
as in one part of the cap. These two edgings brought together, and
thus running up for the space of 6 inches, are stopped by a piece of woven
silk lace, 3¼ inches by 2 inches, and figured with the filfot or gammadion.
The linen is very fine, and of that kind which, in the middle ages, was
called “bissus;” tent-like in shape, and closed, it hung in full folds.
Its gold and silken cords, of various colours, as well as those large well-platted
knobs of silk and gold by which it was strung to the upper part
of the crozier, are all quite perfect; and an account of this ornament is
given in the “Church of Our Fathers,” t. ii. p. 210. Dr. Bock has

<p>When new this tissue must have been very showy, but now the
whole of its pattern is somewhat difficult to trace out. The way in
which the large eagle’s head and neck are given, resting upon a broad-scrolled

side charged with a small but rich ornamentation, amid which may be
detected some eaglets.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">
Piece</span> of Silk and Gold Tissue, the ground of which is
gold banded with patterns in blue, red, and green,
divided by narrowed stripes of black; on one golden
band is an Arabic word repeated all through the design. Syrian.
16½ inches by 16 inches.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The value of this fine rich specimen will be instantly appreciated
when it is borne in mind that it is one of the few known examples of
real Saracenic weaving which we have.</p>

<p>Its ornamentation has about it, in the checkered and circular portions
of its design, much of that feeling which shows itself in Saracenic
architecture; and those who remember the court of lions, in the Alhambra
at Granada, will not be surprised at seeing animals figured upon
this piece of stuff so freely.</p>

<p>The broad bands are separated by very narrow black ones, on which
are shown, in gold, short lengths of thick foliage like strawberry-leaves,
and an animal, which, from the tuft of hair on its ears, seems a lynx,
chased by the hunting-leopard, of which our celebrated travelling
countryman, Sir John Mandeville, in his “Voiage,” written in the
reign of Edward III, speaks thus: “In Cipre men hunten with Papyonns
that ben lyche Lepardes, and thei taken wylde bestes righte
welle and thei ben somedelle more than Lyonns; and thei taken more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
scharpely the bestes and more delyverly than don houndes.” Ed. Halliwell,
p. 29. This sort of leopard, the claws of which are not, like the
rest of its kind, retractile, is, to this day, employed in Asia, more especially
in the East Indies, like dogs for hunting, and known by the name
of “Cheetah.”</p>

<p>Each of these lengths is studded with those knots, found so often
upon eastern wares of all sorts, and formed by narrow ribbons interlacing
one another at right angles so as to produce squares or checks;
these knots are alternately large&mdash;of three rows of checks, and small&mdash;of
two rows. Upon one of the large bands, gold in its ground, is, all
along it, woven a sentence in Arabic letters in dusky white, of which
tint is the circular ornament which everywhere stands between this
writing; very likely these characters, as well as the dividing flower,
were once of a crimson colour, which is now faded. The inscribed
sentence itself being figured without the distinctive points, may be
understood various ways. That it is some well-known Oriental saying
or proverb is very likely, and, to hazard a guess, reads thus: “Injury,
hurt, reception,”&mdash;meaning, perhaps, that the individual who has done
you, behind your back, all the harm he can, may, when next he meets
you, utter the greetings and put on all the looks of friendship. Such
was its meaning, as read by the late lamented Oriental scholar, Dr.
Cureton.</p>

<p>Upon the next broad band, on a ground once crimson, are figured,
in gold, the before-mentioned “papyonns,” or hunting-leopards, collared
and in a sitting position under foliage, swans swimming, and an
animal of the gazelle or antelope genus, heraldically lodged regardant,
with a flower-bearing stem in its mouth, and another animal not easily
identified. The remaining two broad bands, one blue, the other green,
are figured, in gold, with squares filled up by checks of an Oriental
character, alternating with quatrefoils sprouting all over into flowers.</p>

<p>Though the silk ground of this elegant stuff must have been once of
a bright crimson tinge, almost the whole of the colour has flown; and
the silver thread, of which the beautifully arranged tree is formed, has

Such events give a warning to manufacturers about the quality
of their dyes, and the purity as well as sort of the metals they may
choose to employ. The manner in which the tree and its graceful
branches are made to stand well out and above the red grounding is
remarkably good; and, altogether, the pattern, composed as it is of a
spider in its web, hanging so nicely between the outspread limbs of the
tree, is as singular as it is pleasing. Of old, a Lombard family bore, as
its blazon, a spider in its web.</p>

18 inches by 16 inches.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This is one of the most elaborate and remarkable specimens of the
mediæval weavers’ works, and shows how well, even with their appliances,
they could gear their looms. The faces of the six-winged
cherubic heads, as well as the hands and faces of the seraphim, vested
in long albs, were originally shaded by needlework, most of which is
now gone. The Umbrian school of design to be seen in the gracefully
floating forms of the angels, is very discernible. This rich stuff must
have been purposely designed and woven for especial liturgical use at
the great Festival of Corpus Christi, and its solemn processions. It may
have been employed for hanging the chancel walls, or for altar-curtains;
but most likely it overspread the long wooden frame-work or portable
table upon which stood, and was thus carried all about the town by two
or four deacons, the Blessed Sacrament enclosed in a tall heavy gold or
silver vessel like the one shown in this textile, and called a “monstrance,”
because, instead of shutting up from public gaze, it displayed
the consecrated host as it was borne about among the people. Dr.
Bock has figured this stuff in his “Geschichte der Liturgischen
Gewänder des Mittelalters.”</p>

in its drawing and invention, of the feelings which spread themselves
all over the sweet gentle Umbrian school of painting, from the days of
its great teacher the graceful Giotto. The lover, too, of ecclesiastical
symbolism will, in this small piece, find much to draw his attention

red, seeded and barbed, would, at first sight, lead to the thought that its
designer had in his mind some recollection of the English Yorkist and
Lancastrian strife-stirring and direful badges; but it must have been
woven some years before the war of the Roses raged in all its wildness
through the length and breadth of this land.</p>

<p>Not only is this little bag nicely embroidered, but it has a lining of
crimson sarcenet, and is supplied with platted silken strings of several
colours for drawing its mouth close, as well as another silk string made
after the same fashion, for carrying it in the hand. In church inventories
of the period mention is often found of silk bags holding relics,
and from Dr. Bock we learn that in the sacristy of St. Gereon’s, at Cologne,
may yet be seen just such another bag, which served, if it does
not still serve, as a sort of reliquary. For taking to the sick and dying,
the holy Eucharist shut up in a small silver or ivory box, such little bags
were and yet are employed, but then they were borne slung round the
neck of the priest, which in this instance could not be done, as the cord
is too short. Bags for prayer-books are often figured, but this one is
too small for such a purpose; its most probable use was that of a reliquary.</p>

Two</span> Pieces of Embroidery, in silk and gold thread
upon white linen; the one shows our Saviour bearing
His cross; the other, an inscription with the date
1442. These pieces have been mounted on a piece of crimson
damask of a much later date. The embroideries, German,
middle of 15th century; the crimson silk, Lyons, late 17th
century. 6 inches square.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To all appearance, this figure of our Lord carrying His cross to
Calvary, as well as the inscription above it, formed part of the orphrey
of a chasuble, and to preserve it, was mounted upon the crimson silk
which is stiffened by a thin board; and from the black loop at top it
seems it was hung as a devotional picture upon the wall, most likely, of
a private oratory or bed-room. As a work of art, the figure of our
Lord is beautiful. The head, hands, and feet, as well as the crossed
nimbus in gold, the cross, and the ground strewed with flowers, are
worked with the needle; while the folds of the white linen garment are
all, with but a very few strokes, marked by brown lines put in with the
brush. The inscription, quite a separate piece, done in gold upon thin
brown silk lined with canvas, reads thus:&mdash;Wyderoyd Pastor S.
Jac(obi) Colon(iensis). 1442.</p>

<p>In its original state it must have been, as now, “applied,” and not
wrought upon the vestment itself, and affords a good hint to those who
are striving to bring back the use of such a mode of embroidery in cut
work.</p>

is the great manufactory for Africa of the same sort of ornament.</p>

<p>In this textile the warp is of white strong linen thread, the woof of

adornments for church use; the liturgical girdle neither is, nor ever
was made, according to the Latin rite, of so broad a width, nor after
such a fashion; in the Greek ritual, broad girdles are in use.</p>

<p>The weavers of laces for carriage-trimming, or the adornment of

<p>Genoa had earned for itself a notoriety, about this period, for its

above the rest of the pile; such examples, as distinguished from what
is called cut or raised velvet, are very rare. The tone, too, of the fine

Box</span> covered with crimson raised velvet, having, round
the lid, a many-coloured cotton fringe. It holds two
liturgical pallæ, both of fine linen and figured&mdash;one
mounted on pasteboard and measuring 7¾ inches by 7¼ inches,
with an altar and two figures; the other, with the Crucifixion
and St. Mary and St. John, measuring 9½ inches by 9¾ inches.
Inside the lid of this box is an illuminated border of flowers, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
the central design is effaced. Velvet, Italian, 16th century, all
the paintings very late 15th century, and German. Box, 10
inches by 9½ inches.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As a case for holding “corporals” and “palls,” this box is a
curiosity, in its way, of rare occurrence. It must be carefully distinguished
from a square sort of case for the “corporal,” and called the
“burse.” The corporal is a large square piece of fine linen; and at
one time the chalice at mass not only stood upon it but was covered too
by its inward border; but for a long period, the usage has been and is
to put upon the chalice, instead of any part of the corporal, a much
smaller separate square piece of fine linen, often stiffened, the better to
serve its purpose, with card-board, like this example; such is a pall,
and the one before us is figured, we may say illuminated, with what used
to be called, in England, St. Gregory’s Pity; “Church of our Fathers,”
i. 53. Upon an altar, around which are the instruments of the Passion,
and on one side St. Peter, known by the key in his hand, and on the
other the cock on the column, crowing, stands our Lord all bleeding,
with the blood trickling into a chalice between His feet. At the foot
of the altar kneels, veiled for mass, St. Gregory the Great, behind
whom we see, holding a book in both hands, St. Jerome, robed as a
cardinal; the whole is framed in a floriated border. The other, and
unstiffened “pall,” is illuminated with the Crucifixion after the usual
conventional manner, in all respects, that prevailed at the time it was
done, that is, somewhere about the year 1490. As specimens on linen
these two palls are rather rare. The border of flowers, on vellum,
attached to the inside of the lid, is a free, well-coloured, and pleasing
example of the Flemish school late in the 15th century. The raised
velvet is of a rich crimson tone, and from Lucca or Genoa.</p>

<p>Though, in later times, employed as an ordinary case for the cleanly
keeping after service of the corporals or pieces of fine linen, always spread
out in the middle of the altar-stone for the host and chalice to rest upon,
at mass, its first use seems to have been for reservation of the Blessed
Sacrament consecrated on Maundy Thursday to serve at the celebration
of the divine office on Good Friday morning, as we have fully set
forth in the Introduction § 5, and again while describing a similar box,
No. 5958.</p>

<p>In the present specimen all that remains of the vellum illumination,
once upon the inside of the lid, is a wreath of painted flowers, within
which stood the missing Crucifixion. The absence of that scene is,
however, well supplied by the other kind of art-work wrought in colours
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
of the same subject; done, too, after a broad bold manner, upon a square
piece of very fine linen, which, as it is moveable, serves now as a
lining for the lower inside of this case.</p>

<p>Such ecclesiastical appliances are rare, so much so, that, besides the
two in this collection, none is known to be in this country; while very
few, even on the Continent, are to be seen at the present day.</p>

<p>The velvet of the apparel is of a fine rich pile, and the tone of

the needle but woven. Such a liturgical appliance is not now often

to be noticed, that while the amice itself&mdash;that is, the linen portion of
this vestment&mdash;is remarkable for its large size, the velvet apparel sewed
on it is broader and shorter than those which we find figured on English
ecclesiastical monuments during the mediæval period. The narrow green
ferret which hems the apparel is usually found employed as a binding in
crimson liturgical garments anciently made in Flanders. Though the
velvet was woven in Spain, this linen amice seems to have once belonged
to some Flemish sacristy: at one period the connection between the two
countries was drawn very close.</p>

Linen</span> Cloth or Corporal, with an edge on all its four
sides; 2¼ inches broad, embroidered in blue, white,
and yellow silks. German, late 15th century. 22
inches by 21 inches.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To the student of ecclesiastical antiquities this liturgical appliance
will be a great curiosity, from its being so much larger than the corporals
now in use; but its size may be easily accounted for. From being put
over the altar-cloth, on the middle of the table of the altar, so that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
priest, at mass, might place the host and chalice immediately upon it
before and after the consecration of the Eucharist, it got, and still keeps
the name of “corporale,” about which the reader may consult
“Hierurgia,” p. 74, 2nd edition.</p>

<p>The embroidery, seemingly of a vine, is somewhat remarkable from
being, like Indian needlework, the same on both sides, and was so done for
a purpose to be noticed below. Its greater size may be easily explained.
During the middle ages, as in England, so in Germany, the usage was
to cover the chalice on the altar, not with a little square piece of linen
called a “palla,” two specimens of which are mentioned, <a href="#h-8327">No. 8327</a>,
but with the corporal itself, as shown in those illuminations copied and
given as a frontispiece to the fourth volume of the “Church of our
Fathers.” To draw up for this purpose the inner edge of the corporal,
it was made, as needed, larger than the one now in use. Moreover, as
the under side of the embroidery would thus be turned upwards and conspicuously
shown, even on the consecrated chalice, to a great extent;
and as anything frayed and ragged&mdash;and this single embroidery always
is on the under side&mdash;would, at such a time, in such a place, have been
most unseemly; to hinder this disrespect the embroidery was made
double, that is, as perfect on the one side as on the other, giving the
design clear and accurate on both, so that whichever part happened to
be turned upwards it looked becoming.</p>

Piece</span> of Silk Damask; green, with pattern of crowns
connected by wavy ribbons, in each space is a rose.
North Italian, 15th century. 22 inches by 21 inches.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This fine and valuable piece of damask exhibits a very effective design,
which is thoroughly heraldic in all its elements. Of these, the
first are roselettes&mdash;single roses having five petals each&mdash;seeded and
barbed, and every petal folds inward very appropriately; all about each
roselette roves a bordure nebulé, significative in heraldry of a cloud-wreath,
above which and just over the flower rests an open crown, the
hoop of which is studded with jewels, and bears on the upper rim two
balls&mdash;pearls&mdash;on pyramidal points, and three fleurs-de-lis. To take
these roselettes for the Tudor flower would be a great mistake, as it was
not thought of at the period when this stuff was manufactured, besides
which, it is never shown as a roselette or single rose, but as a very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
double one. It is not unlikely that this damask was, in the first instance,
ordered from Italy, if not by our Edward IV, at least by one of the
Yorkist party after the Lancastrian defeat at Mortimer’s Cross: the
crown with its fringe of clouds seems to point to the curious appearance
in the heavens that day. When once his loom was geared the Lombard
weaver would not hesitate to work off stuffs after the same pattern
ordered by his English customer and sell them in the Italian markets.</p>

<p>The needlework is a very favourable specimen of Flemish embroidery,
and the management of the three subjects shows that the hand
that wrought them was quickened with a feeling love for the school of
Hans Memling, who has made Bruges to be the pilgrimage of many an
admirer of the beautiful in Christian art. The holy woman, who, according
to the old tradition, gave a napkin to our Lord on His way to
Calvary, is figured, at top, holding, outstretched before her to our view,
this linen cloth showing shadowed on it the head of our Redeemer
crowned with thorns and trickling with blood: the Saint became
known as St. Veronica, and the handkerchief itself as the “Varnicle.”
Just below, we have the Blessed Virgin Mary seated and holding on
her knees the infant Saviour, before whom kneels St. Bernard, the
famous abbot of Clairvaux, in the white Cistercian habit which he had
received from our fellow-countryman, St. Stephen Harding, the
founder of the Cistercian Order, about the year 1114. The group
itself is an early example of a once favourite subject in St. Bernard’s
life, thus referred to by Mrs. Jameson, in one of her charming books:&mdash;“It
was said of him (St. Bernard) that when he was writing his
famous homilies on ‘The Song of Songs which is Solomon’s,’ the Holy
Virgin herself condescended to appear to him, and moistened his lips
with the milk from her bosom; so that ever afterwards his eloquence,
whether in speaking or in writing, was persuasive, irresistible, super-natural.”
(Legends of the Monastic Orders, p. 142). Lower still,
St. Bernard, with his abbot’s pastoral staff, cast upon the ground by
his side, is praying, on bended knees, before a crucifix, from off of
which our Redeemer has loosened Himself to fall into the arms of the
saint, who was so fond of meditating on all the throes of our Lord upon
the cross.</p>

Piece</span> of Crimson Velvet, spangled with gold and silver
stars, and embroidered with leaves and flowers in gold
thread, once dotted with precious stones. North
Italian, end of the 15th century. 14½ inches by 5¼ inches.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Genoese velvet of this piece is of a very deep ruby tone, deeper
than usual; but the way in which it is ornamented should not be passed
over by those who wish to learn one among the very effective styles of
embroidering. The design consists chiefly of branches gracefully bent
in all directions and sprouting out, here and there, with leaves and
variously fashioned flowers which, from one example that still holds its
tiny round-headed piece of coloured glass set in a silver gilt socket, bore
in them mock precious stones, and perhaps seed-pearls. These branches
themselves are made of common hempen string, edged on both sides
with a thread of gold of a smaller bulk, and the flowers are heightened
to good effect by the bright red stitches of the crimson silk with which
the gold that forms them is sewed in; and the whole of the design
appears to have been worked, first upon a strong canvas, from which it
was afterwards cut and appliqué upon its velvet ground. All the space
between the boughs is sprinkled rather thickly with six-rayed stars of
gold and silver, but the latter ones have turned almost black. This
piece was once the apparel for the lower border of an alb.</p>

toe part of a silk stocking. Though of a much finer texture, it much
resembles, in pattern, the yellow silk pair of stockings belonging now to
the Marquis of Salisbury, but once presented by Lord Hunsdon to Queen
Elizabeth, and said to be the first ever made in England.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This piece affords a very instructive instance of how velvet textiles
were not unfrequently treated. The pattern was first wrought in the
weaving, and made the fabric what is now known as cut or raised
velvet. Then those parts left bare of the silken pile were filled in by
hand-embroidery, done in gold, silver, and silks of various colours, as
the fancy of the individual might like, and produced a mixed work
similar to the one before us. The velvet itself of this specimen is poor
in colour and thin in substance, but the gold thread is of the finest, and
admirably put together; and those little specks of the crimson silk employed
in sewing it on, help, in no small manner, to heighten its brilliancy
and effect.</p>

Linen</span> Napkin, or rather Sindon or Pyx-cloth, the

Perhaps Flemish, 16th century. 18½ inches
by 16½ inches.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In more senses than one this small linen cloth is of great value,
being, in the first place, a liturgical appliance of the mediæval period,
now unused in this form, certainly unique in this country, and hardly
ever to be met with on the continent, either in private hands or public
collections. According to ancient English custom, the pyx containing
particles of the Blessed Eucharist for giving, at all hours of day or night,
the Holy Communion to the dying, and kept hanging up over the high
altar of every church in this land, was overspread with one of such fine
linen and embroidered veils, as may be seen in an illumination from the
“Life of St. Edmund, King and Martyr,” in the Harley Collection,
British Museum, and engraved in the “Church of our Fathers,” t. iv.
p. 206.</p>

<p>The readers of English history will, no doubt, feel an interest in
this specimen, when they learn that, with such a linen napkin, Mary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
Queen of Scots had her face muffled just before she laid her head upon
the block: “Then the maid, Kennedy, took a handkerchief, edged with
gold, in which the Eucharist had formerly been enclosed, and fastened
it over her eyes.” “Pict. Hist. of England, ed. Knight,” t. ii. p. 671.
Knight is wrong in saying that the Holy Eucharist had ever been immediately
enclosed in this cloth, which is only the veil that used to be cast
over the pyx or small vessel in which the consecrated hosts were kept,
as we observed in the introduction, § 5.</p>

tips of his fingers after washing them, the while he said that prayer,
“Munda me, Domine,” &amp;c. in the Salisbury Missal; “Church of our
Fathers,” t. iv. p. 150. By the rubrics of the Roman Missal, the priest
was, and yet is, directed to say, at the ritual washing of his hands, that
portion of the 25th Psalm, which begins, verse 6, “Lavabo manus
meas,” &amp;c. “Hierurgia,” p. 21; hence these small liturgical towels
got, and still keep, the name of Lavabo cloths or Lavaboes, especially in
all those countries where the Roman Missal is in use.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This fine dalmatic&mdash;for the liturgical use of which the reader may
consult the “Church of our Fathers,” t. i. p. 375&mdash;is rather curious
for the way in which the two very singular tassels hanging on the back
from the shoulders are ornamented. These usual appendages are in
this instance made of remarkably long (15 inches) flakes of white, red,
and deep-brown silken thread, and, instead of silk nobs at the end of
the cords, have large round balls of rock crystal. The orphreys, or
stripes, down both sides, before and behind, are 2½ inches broad, woven
in gold and charged with squares of flower-bearing trees, and inscribed
in blue with “Jhesus,” “Maria.” The fringes on the two lower
borders of the dalmatic, 3½ inches deep, are alternately red, green,
white, and blue, and those on the sides and around the sleeves are much
narrower. The sleeves themselves from being 18 inches wide at the
shoulder become as narrow as 12 inches towards the wrist. The two
apparels on the upper part, before and behind, are woven in gold, and
measure 16½ inches in length, and 5¼ inches in breadth; the one on the back
just under the neck is figured with three golden-grounded squares, the
centre one ornamented with a crimson quatrefoil, barbed, and enclosing
a various-coloured conventional flower; the other two, with a green
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
tree blossomed with red flowers: the apparel across the breast is inscribed
with the names, in large blue letters, of “Jhesus,” “Maria.”
Half way down the back hangs, transversely, a shield of arms quarterly,
one and four <i>gules</i>, two bars <i>argent</i>, between seven fleurs-de-lis,
<i>or</i>, three, two, and two; two and three, <i>sable</i> two bars, <i>argent</i>: as a
crest, a full-forward open-faced helmet, with six bars all gold, surmounted
by a pair of horns barred <i>sable</i> and <i>argent</i>, with mantlings of
the same. This blazon, according to English heraldry, would indicate
that the giver of this splendid vestment&mdash;and very likely it was only one
of a large set&mdash;could boast, by showing the golden five-barred full-forward
helmet, of royal blood in his pedigree, and was not lower than
a Duke in title. Dr. Bock has figured this finely-preserved dalmatic
in his “Geschichte der Liturgischen Gewänder des Mittelalters,”

<p>The hood which, it should be observed by those curious in liturgical

an elaborate and well-wrought piece of needlework; and strongly
reminds one of the picture of the same subject&mdash;the death-bed of the
Mother of our Lord&mdash;by Martin Schön, now in the National Gallery.
All the Apostles are supposed to be gathered round her; to the right of
the spectator stands St. Peter sprinkling her with holy water from the
silver sprinkle in his right hand; next to this chief celebrant is St. John,
the acolyte, with the holy water stoop in his left hand, and in his right
the lighted taper, which he is about to put into the hand of his adopted
mother&mdash;an emblem of the lighted lamp with which each wise virgin
in the Gospel awaited the coming of the bridegroom. Behind him again,
and with his back turned, is another apostle, blowing into the half-extinguished
thurible, which he is raising to his mouth; the rest of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
the Apostles are nicely grouped around. The ground of this hood
is of rich gold thread, and the figures of the scene are separately
wrought and afterwards “applied.” The orphreys, that are rather
narrow, measuring only 5½ inches in breadth, are of a golden web and
figured, on the right hand side, with St. Mary Magdalen, carrying a box
of ointment in her hands; St. Bernadin of Siena, holding a circular
radiated disc inscribed with I.H.S. in his right hand, and in his left a
Latin cross; St. Bicta&mdash;for so the inscription seems to read&mdash;bearing the

the Queen of Hungary, with a child’s article of dress in one

mitre and cope, and holding in his right hand a crozier, in his left a
church; St. Ursula, with the martyr’s palm in one hand; in the other
a long large silver arrow, and having six of her martyred virgins
at her sides; and St. John Baptist, with the “Lamb of God” on the
palm of his left hand, and the forefinger of the right outstretched as
pointing to it. The heads of all these figures are done in silk and “applied,”
but the hands and diapering of the garments, as well as the emblems,
are wrought by the needle, in gold or in silk, upon the golden
web-ground of these orphreys. At the lower part of the hood is
“applied” a shield&mdash;no doubt the armorials of the giver of this fine
cope&mdash;party per pale&mdash;<i>gules</i> two chevronels <i>argent</i>, a chief <i>or</i>&mdash;<i>azure</i>
three garbs (one lost), <i>argent</i>, two and one.</p>

<p>The cloth of gold is none of the richest, and may have been woven

shows a female saint holding a sword in her right hand, and in her left
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
a two-masted boat&mdash;perhaps St. Mary Magdalen, in reference to her
penitence and voyage to France; St. John with a cup, and the
demon serpent coming up out of it; the Empress Helen carrying a
cross (?). The orphrey in front, three inches broad, gives us, in smaller
circles, St. Simon the apostle with his saw; a female saint (Hedwiges?)
holding a cross; and two prophets, each with a rolled-up scroll in his
hand. On the back, and far apart from the orphrey, is a shield <i>argent</i>
(nicely diapered), a chevron <i>sable</i> between three leaves slipped <i>vert</i>,
hanging as it does on the left hand, it may be presumed there was
another shield on the right, but it is gone. This chasuble, small as it
is now, must have been sadly reduced across the shoulders, from its
original breadth.</p>

Liturgical</span> Cloth of grey linen thread, figured all
over with subjects from the New Testament, angels,
apostles, flowers, and monsters. Rhenish, end of the
14th century. 10 feet by 3 feet.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This curious and valuable piece, of the kind denominated “opus
araneum,” or spider-web, is very likely the oldest as well as one
among the very finest specimens yet known of that peculiar sort of
needlework. The design is divided into two lengths, one much shorter
than the other, and reversed; thus evidently proving that its original use
was to cover, not the altar, but the lectern, upon which the Evangeliarium,
or Book of the Gospels, is put at high mass for the deacon
to sing the gospel from: judging by the subjects wrought upon it, and
in white, it appears to have been intended more especially for the daily
high mass, chaunted in many places every morning in honour of the
Blessed Virgin Mary.</p>

<p>Beginning at the lower part of the longer length, we see an angel,
vested like a deacon, in an appareled and girded alb, playing the violin,
then six apostles&mdash;St. Simon with the fuller’s bat in his hand, St. Matthias
with sword and book, St. James the Greater with pilgrim’s
bourdon or staff, St. Jude, or Thaddeus, with club and book, St.
Andrew with book and saltire cross, St. Thomas with spear; then
another like vested angel sounding a guitar&mdash;all of which figures are
standing in a row amid oak boughs and flowery branches. Higher up,
and within a large quatrefoil encircled by the words:&mdash;☩ “Magnificat:
Anima: mea: Dominum;” the Visitation, or the Blessed Virgin
Mary and St. Elizabeth, both with outstretched hands, one towards the
other, the first as a virgin with her hair hanging down upon her
shoulders, the second having her head shrouded in a hood like a married
woman; they stand amid lily-bearing stems (suggested by the lesson
read on that festival from Canticles ii.); in each of the north and south
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
petals of the quatrefoil is a kneeling angel, deacon-vested, holding in
each hand a bell, which he is ringing, while in the east and west petals
are other like-robed angels, both incensing with a thurible. Outside
the quatrefoil are represented within circles at the south-west corner
the British St. Ursula&mdash;one of the patron saints of Cologne&mdash;standing
with a book in one hand, and an arrow in the other; at the south-east
corner St. Helen (?), with cross and book; at the north-west, St. Lucy
with book and pincers; at the north-east, a virgin martyr, with a book
and a branch of palm. At each of the angles, in the corners between
the petals, is an open crown. Above stands in the middle a double-handled
vase, between two wyverns, jessant oak branches. Over this
species of heraldic border is another large quatrefoil arranged in precisely
the same manner: the angels&mdash;two with bells, two with
thuribles&mdash;are there, so too are the corner crowns, within and encircled
by the words ☩ Gloria: in: exc(e)l(s)is: Deo: et: in: terr(a), we
have the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, after this manner:
seated upon a throne is our Lord in majesty, that is, crowned and holding
the mund or ball surmounted by a cross in His left hand; with His
right He is giving His blessing to His mother, who is seated also on the
same throne, crowned, with her hair about her shoulders, and with
hands upraised to Him as in the act of prayer. At the top, to the
left, is St. Catherine, with a sword in one hand, a wheel armed with
spikes in the other; to the right, St. Dorothy, with a blooming branch
in one hand and in the other a basket&mdash;made like a cup with foot and
stem&mdash;full of flowers; below, St. Barbara, with tower and palm-branch,
in the left side; on the other, St. Mary Magdalen, with an ointment box
and palm. Here the design is reversed, and very properly so, as otherwise
it would be, when thrown over the lectern, upside down; and
curiously enough, just at this place there is a large hole, caused, as is
clear, by this part of the needlework being worn away from the continual
rubbing of some boss or ornament at the top of the folding lectern,
which most likely was wrought in iron. This shorter length of
the design&mdash;that portion which hung behind&mdash;begins with the double-handled
vase and two wyverns, and has but one quatrefoil arranged like
the other two in the front part: within the circle inscribed ☩ Ecce:
ancilla: Domini: fiat: michi&mdash;we see the Annunciation; kneeling
before a low reading desk, with an open book upon it, is the Blessed
Virgin Mary, with the Holy Ghost under the form of a nimbed dove
coming down from heaven, signified by the nebulæ or clouds, upon
her; and turning about with arms wide apart, as if in wonderment,
she is listening to Gabriel on his knees and speaking his message in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
those words:&mdash;ave: gracia: ple(na), traced upon the scroll, which,
with both his hands, he holds before him. In the corners of the
petals are, at top, to the left, a female saint, with a cross in one
hand, a closed book in the other; to the right, a female saint with
palm-branch and book; below, to the left, a female saint&mdash;St. Martina,
V. M.&mdash;with book and a two-pronged and barbed fork; on the
right, a female saint with a book, and cup with a lid. As the other
end began, so this ends, with a row of eight figures, of which two are
angels robed as deacons, one playing the violin, the other the guitar;
then come six apostles&mdash;St. John the Evangelist exorcising the poisoned
cup; St. Bartholomew, with book in one hand and flaying knife in the
other; St. Peter, with book and key; St. Paul, with book and sword
held upwards; St. Matthew, with sword held downwards, and book;
St. Philip, with book and cross.</p>

<p>The figures within the quatrefoils and of the apostles are about
seven inches high; those of the female saints&mdash;all virgins, as is shown
by the hair hanging in long tresses about their shoulders&mdash;measure six
inches. The spaces between are filled in with branches of five-petaled
and barbed roses, and at both ends there originally hung a prettily
knotted long fringe. All the female saints are dressed in gowns with
very long remarkable sleeves&mdash;a fashion in woman’s attire which prevailed
at the end of the 14th and beginning of the 15th centuries.</p>

<p>The exact way in which these now very rare specimens of mediæval
needlework used to be employed in the celebration of the liturgy, may
be seen, by a glance, on looking at any of those engravings in which are
figured a few of those old lecterns; made either of light thin wood, or
iron, or of bronze, so as they could be easily folded up: they were thus
with readiness carried about from one part to another of the choir, or
chancel, even by a boy. When set down the veil was cast over them.
Some of our own archæological works afford us good examples of such
lecterns; as fine, if not finer, are those two which M. Viollet Le Duc
has given in his instructive “Dictionnaire du Mobilier Français,” t. i.
pp. 162, 163, especially that from the Hotel de Cluny. Speaking of the
coverings for such lecterns, he tells that in the treasury of Sens Cathedral
there yet may be found one which is, however, according to his
admeasurements, much smaller every way than this piece of curious
needlework before us. Whether the one now at Sens be of the
10th or 11th century assigned it, far too early date to our thinking,
it cannot, to judge from the coloured plate given by M. Viollet
Le Duc, be put for a moment in competition with the present one,
as an art-work done by the needle. In our own mediæval records
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
notices of such lecterns may be sometimes found; in the choir of
Cobham College, Kent, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1479, there was such an article of church
furniture, “Church of our Fathers,” ii. 201, and doubtless it was usually
covered with a veil.</p>

from which shoots up the thin stem of a tree between two

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This stuff betrays a few lingering traditions of the Persian style of
design, and some people will see in the little tree between those hunting
leopards the “hom,” or sacred tree of the olden belief of that country.
The material of it is thin and poor, and in width it measures twenty-one
inches. The characters under the vase holding the leopards and
“hom,” are but an imitation of Arabic, and hence we may presume
that it was woven by Jewish or Christian workmen for the European
market, and to make it pass better, as if coming from Persia, inscribed
as best they knew how, with Arabic letters, or imitations of that
alphabet.</p>

German, 15th century. 3 feet 8½ inches by 2 feet 5 inches.</p>

<p>The birds that are shown on this blue-grounded piece of rather

flowers, and three very much larger flowers stand high above their
heads; the beasts are leopards, with their skin well spotted, and they
seem to be, as it were, scenting and scratching the ground. The orphrey,
cross-shaped, and 5½ inches wide, is overspread with gracefully intertwined
rose-branches, the leaves of which are of gold shaded green,
and the flowers in silver, seeded and barbed. It is blazoned all over
with armorial bearings, seemingly of two houses, of which the first is a
shield, tincture gone, charged with a lion rampant <i>or</i>, langued and armed
<i>gules</i>; the second, a shield, barry of twelve, <i>gules</i> and <i>or</i>, with a lion
rampant, <i>argent</i>, langued and armed <i>azure</i>, in the dexter canton.
There are three of each of these shields, and all six are worked on
canvas, and afterwards sewed on. On the upright stem of the cross
may be read in places the name of “Lodewich Fretie,” the individual
who bore those arms and gave the chasuble.</p>

<p>Among the monsters, we have the usual heraldic ones that so often

persuades us that this piece, entirely the produce of the loom, came
from French, very likely Parisian hands, and was wrought for female
use, as a band or fillet to confine the hair about the forehead, just as we
see must have been the fashion in England at the time from the marked
way in which that attire is shown in the illuminations of MSS. and
sepulchral effigies of our Plantagenet epoch. Our countryman, John
Garland, tells us, as we noticed in our Introduction, that women-weavers,

Within circles, divided by a tree made to look like a floriated cross,

upon the boughs of a tree, are perched two doves; while the spandrils
or spaces between the circles are filled in with fleurs-de-lis growing out
of leafed stalks. Though, in after times, it may have been applied to
church use, it seems, like the specimen under <a href="#h-8569">No. 8569</a>, to have been
at first intended for female dress, either as a girdle or head attire.</p>

sprouting out on two sides with fleurs-de-lis, four-legged monsters,
some like winged lions, some biting their tails, doves in pairs upholding

<p>The ends of this stole, German work of the 14th century, widen
like most others of the period, and in their original state seem to
have been studded with small precious stones, the sockets for which
are very discernible amid the beads; and in each centre must have
been let in a tiny illumination, as one still is there showing the
Blessed Virgin Mary with our Lord, as a child, in her arms; and
this appears to have been covered with glass. Amid the beads are
yet a few thick silver-gilt spangles wrought like six-petaled flowers.
As a stole, the present one is very short, owing, no doubt, to a scanty
length of the gold tissue; in fact, it might easily be taken for a long
maniple. When it is remembered that the Suabian house of Hohenstaufen
reigned in Sicily for many years, till overthrown in the person
of the young Conradin, at the battle of Tagliacozzo, by the French
Charles of Anjou, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1268, we can easily account for Sicilian textiles
of all sorts finding their way, during the period, into Germany. In his
“Geschichte der Liturgischen Gewänder des Mittelalters,” 4 Lieferung,
pt. xviii. fig. 3, Dr. Bock has given a figure of this stole.</p>

Piece</span> of Silk and Linen Tissue; ground, yellow, with

<div class="blockquot">

<p>From a small piece to the left, figured with what looks like an
English bloodhound or talbot, it would seem that we have not the full
design in the pattern of this curious stuff, which speaks so loudly of the
feudalism of mediæval Italy and other continental countries. Seldom
was a king then figured without his crown, besides carrying his hawk on
hand and being followed by his dogs, like any other lord of the land.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
The little hound behind him is somewhat singular. To us it appears
curious that such an elaborate and princely design, meant evidently
for the hangings of some palace, should have been done in the rather
mean materials which we find. Parts seem to have been woven in gold
thread; but so thin and debased was the metal that it is now quite
black, and the linen warp far outweighs the thin silken woof.</p>

Piece</span> of Silk Tissue; ground, green; pattern, a so-called
pomegranate of elaborate form, amid flowers of
white and light purple, now faded, both largely wrought
in gold. Spanish, 15th century. 1 foot 11 inches by 1 foot
2 inches.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Not only is the design of the pattern very effective, but the gold, in
which the far larger part of it is done, looks bright and rather rich; yet,
by examining it with a powerful glass, we may discover an ingenious,
not to say trickish, way for imitating gold-covered thread. Skins of
thin vellum were gilt, and not very thickly; these were cut into very
narrow filament-like shreds, and in this form&mdash;that is, flat with the
shining side facing the eye&mdash;afterwards woven into the pattern as if
they were thread, a trick in trade which the Spaniards learned from
the Moors.</p>

<p>The warp is of a poor kind of silk not unlike jute, and the woof
is partly of cotton, partly linen thread, so that with its mock gold filaments
we have a showy textile out of cheap materials; a valuable
specimen of the same sort of stuff from a Saracenic loom will be found
under <a href="#h-8639">No. 8639</a>, &amp;c.</p>

Two</span> Pieces of Silk Tissue; ground, a bright green;

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
faded as to look a purplish black. Sicilian, early 14th century.
7½ inches by 4½ inches; 4½ inches by 4½ inches.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This is a specimen interesting for several reasons. When new and
fresh, this stuff must have been very pleasing; the elaborate design of
its pattern, done in a cheerful spring-like tone of green upon a ground
of a much lighter shade of the same colour, makes it welcome to the
eye. The giraffes, tripping and addorsed, with their long necks and
parded skins, have something like a housing on their backs. From such
a quadruped being figured on this stuff, he who drew the design must
have lived in Africa, or have heard of the animal from the Moors; he
must have been a Christian, too, for green being Mohammed’s own
colour, and even still limited, in its use, to his descendants, no Saracenic
loom would have figured this stuff with a forbidden form of an animal.
Yet, withal, there may be seen upon it strong traces of Saracenic feeling
in its pattern. That singular ornament, made up of long zero-like forms
placed four together in three rows, which we find upon other examples
in this curious collection (No. 8596, &amp;c.), seems distinctive of some particular
locality; so that we may presume this fine textile to have been
wrought at the royal manufactory of Palermo, where the giraffe might
have been well known, where Saracenic art-traditions a long time
lingered; and people cared nothing for the prohibition of figuring any
created form, or of wearing green in their garments, or hanging their
walls with silks dyed green; in some specimens the zero-like ornamentation
takes the shape of our letter U; moreover the large feathers in
the bird’s long tail are sometimes so figured.</p>

<p>Though this specimen has been sadly ill-used by time, and made out
of several shreds, it evidently came from the hands that designed and
wrought other pieces (Nos. <a href="#h-8591">8591</a>, <a href="#h-8591">8591<span class="allsmcap">A</span></a>, <a href="#h-8596">8596</a>) in this collection.
Upon this, as upon them, we have the same elements in the pattern&mdash;the
ellipsis, the giraffes, and that singular kind of ornamentation, a sort
of letter U or flattened O, not put in for any imaginary beauty of form,
but to indicate either place or manufacturer, being a symbol which we
have yet to learn how to read and understand. That in time we shall
be able to find out its meanings there can be little or no doubt.</p>

<p>The narrow stripes running down the broad one, and constituting

<p>Probably in the sample before us we behold a work from the royal

sway of France, in the person of a prince belonging to the house of
Anjou. In the first place, we have the fawn&mdash;a tone of the murrey
colour of our old English writers&mdash;and the light joyous green; in the
second place, the ellipsis was there, though our specimen is too small to
show it all. Those narrow borders that edge the large golden lettered
band present us with a row of golden half-moons and blue fleurs-de-lis
on one side; on the other, a row of golden half-moons and blue cross-crosslets:
on the band itself we find, alternating with foliage, an oblong
square, within which is written a short sentence in Arabic&mdash;a kindly
word, a wish of health and happiness to the wearer&mdash;such as was, and
still is, the custom among the Arabs. Sure is it that this textile, if
wrought by Saracenic hands, was done under a Christian prince, and
that prince a Frenchman.</p>

pattern. With this we find European, or at least Christian, angels,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
clothed in white, but with such curious nebule-nimbs about their heads
as to make their brows look horned, more like spirits of evil than of
good. The open crowns are thoroughly after a western design; and
the head and shoulders of a winged figure, to the left, show that we
have not the entire design before us. From the graceful way in which
the figures are made to float, as well as from several little things about
the scrolls, we may safely conclude that the designer of the pattern lived
in upper Italy, and that this costly and elegant brocade was wrought at
Lucca. Of the Oriental elements of this pattern we have said a few

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Unfortunately, this curious and very valuable sample of Rhenish
needlework is far from being complete, and has lost a good part of its
original composition on its edges, but much more lamentably on the
right hand side. Not for a moment can we think it to have been an
altar-cloth properly so-called, that is, for spreading out over the table
itself of the altar; but, in all likelihood, it was used as a reredos or
ornament over but behind the altar, as a covering for the wall. Another
beautiful specimen of the same kind has been already noticed under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
No. 8358, for throwing over the deacon’s and subdeacon’s lectern at high
mass; and, from the fact that, in both instances, the subjects figured
are in especial honour of the B. V. Mary, it would seem that, in many
German churches, and following a very ancient tradition that the Blessed
Virgin wrought during all her girlhood days ornaments for the Temple
of Jerusalem with her needle, the custom was to have for the “Mary
Mass,” and for altars dedicated under her name, as many liturgical
appliances as might be of this sort of white needlework, and done by
maidens’ hands.</p>

<p>In the centre we have the coronation of the B. V. Mary, executed
after the ordinary fashion, with her hair falling down her shoulders,
and a crown upon her head; she is sitting with arms uplifted in prayer,
upon a Gothic throne, by her Divine Son, who, while holding the
mund in His left, is blessing His mother with raised right hand; over-head
is hovering an angel with a thurible; at each of the four corners
is an Evangelist represented, not only by his usual emblem, but announced
by his name in Latin. At first sight the angel, the emblem of
St. Matthew might be taken for Gabriel announcing the Incarnation to
the B. V. Mary. Above and around are circles formed of the Northern
Kraken, four in number, put in orb, and running round an elaborately
floriated Greek cross, symbolizing the victory of Christianity over
heathenism. In many places, within a gracefully twining wreath of
trefoil leaves and roses barbed, is the letter G, very probably the initial
of the fair hand who wrought and gave this beautiful work to our
Lady’s altar; and the spaces between the subjects are filled in with well-managed
branches of the oak bearing acorns. To the left is seen a
hind or countryman hooded, carrying, hung down from a long club
borne on his shoulder, a dead hare; and further on, still to the left, an
old man who with a lance is trying to slay an unicorn that is running
at full speed to a maiden who is sitting with her hair hanging about her
shoulders, and stroking the forehead of the animal with her left hand.
The symbolism of this curious group, not often to be met with, significative
of the mystery of the Incarnation, is thus explained by the Anglo-Norman
poet, Phillippe de Thaun, who wrote his valuable “Bestiary”
in England for the instruction of his patroness, Adelaide of Louvaine,
Queen to our Henry I:&mdash;“Monoceros is an animal which has one horn
on its head; it is caught by means of a virgin: now hear in what
manner. When a man intends to hunt it and to take and ensnare it,
he goes to the forest where is its repair, there he places a virgin with
her breast uncovered, and by its smell the monoceros perceives it; then
it comes to the virgin and kisses her breast, falls asleep on her lap, and
so comes to its death: the man arrives immediately, and kills it in its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
sleep, or takes it alive and does as he likes with it.... A beast of this
description signifies Jesus Christ; one God he is and shall be, and was
and will continue so; he placed himself in the virgin, and took flesh
for man’s sake: a virgin she is and will be, and will always remain.
This animal in truth signifies God; know that the virgin signifies St.
Marye; by her breast we understand similarly Holy Church; and
then by the kiss it ought to signify that a man when he sleeps is in semblance
of death; God slept as a man, who suffered death on the cross,
and His destruction was our redemption, and His labour our repose,”
&amp;c.&mdash;“Popular Treatises on Science written during the Middle Ages,
&amp;c., and edited for the Historical Society of Science by T. Wright,”
pp. 81, 82.</p>

<p>The figure of the countryman carrying off the hare is brought
forward in illustration. As the rough coarse clown, prowling about
the lands of his lord, wilily entraps the hare in his hidden snares, so
does the devil, by allurements to sin, strive to catch the soul of man.
These interesting symbolisms end the left-hand portion of the reredos.
Going to the right, we find that part torn and injured in such a way
that it is evidently shorn of its due portions, and much of the original
so completely gone that we are unable to hazard a conjecture about the
subject which was figured there.</p>

<p>So strong is the likeness between this and the stuff at <a href="#h-8359">No. 8359</a>,
both in the texture of the silk and the treatment of the beasts and birds,
that we are led to suppose them to have come from the same identical
workshop. That tree-like ornament, under which the shaggy long-tailed
lion with down-bent head is creeping, seems the traditionary form
of the Persians’ “hom.” The gold is, in most parts, very brilliant,
owing to the broadness of the metal wrapped round the linen thread that
holds it; and, altogether, this is a rich specimen of the Syrian loom.</p>

adornment, while its lining, a work of a century later, is worked with
a palm-like design in thick linen thread. At a later time, it seems to
have been employed as a covering to the table itself of the altar, and is
plentifully sprinkled with spots of wax-droppings.</p>

<p>This unmistakeable specimen of a Saracenic loom would seem to

Granada, Seville, or Cordova.</p>

<p>As a sample of its kind it is valuable, showing, as it does, that the
same feelings which manifested themselves upon Moorish ornamentation
for architecture were displayed in the patterns of textiles among that
people. The fraud, so to say, of gilt shreds of parchment for threads
covered with gold is exemplified here; and hence we may gather that
the Spaniards of the mediæval period learned this trick from their Saracenic
teachers in the arts of the loom. As in <a href="#h-8590">No. 8590</a>, &amp;c., so here,
the gold ground is wrought, not in thread twined with gold foil, but
with gilt vellum cut into very narrow filaments, and worked into the

<p>In this admirable specimen of the Florentine loom we have shown
us the B. V. Mary not quite bare-headed, but partly hooded and nimbed,
as queen-like she sits on a throne, with her arms meetly folded on her
breast, the while she listens to the words of the angel who is on his
knees before her, and uplifting his hand in the act of speaking a benediction,
while in his left he holds the lily-branch, correctly&mdash;which is not
always so in artworks&mdash;blooming with three, and only three, full-blown
flowers. Above the archangel the Holy Ghost is coming down from
heaven in shape of a dove, from whose beak dart forth long rays
of light toward the head of St. Mary. The greater part of the subject
is wrought in gold; the faces, the hands, and flowers are white, and a
very small portion of the draperies blue. The drawing of the figures
is quite after the Umbrian school, and, therefore, not merely good,

The</span> “Vernicle,” embroidered in silk, and now sewed
on a large piece of linen. Flemish, middle of 15th
century. 9½ inches by 7½ inches; the linen, 2 feet
10½ inches by 2 feet 9 inches.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To the readers of old English literature, especially of Chaucer, the
term of “Vernicle” will not be unknown, as expressing the representation
of our Saviour’s face, which He is said to have left upon a
napkin handed Him to wipe His brows, by one of those pious women
who crowded after Him on His road to Calvary. It is noticed, too, in
the “Church of our Fathers,” t. iii. p. 438. This piece of needlework
seems to have been cut off from another, and sewed, at a very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
much later period, to the large piece of linen to which it is now
attached; for the purpose of being put up either in a private chapel,
or over some very small altar in a church, as a sort of reredos; or, perhaps,
it may have originally been one of the apparels on an alb: never,
however, on an amice, being much too large for such a purpose.
One singularity in the subject is the appearance of crimson tassels, one
at each corner of the napkin figured with our Lord’s likeness, which is
kept with great care still, at Rome, among the principal relics in St.
Peter’s, where it is shown in a solemn manner on Easter Monday.
It is one of those representations of a sacred subject called by the
Greeks ἀχειροποίητος, that is, “not made by hands,” or, not the work
of man, as was noticed in the Introduction to the present Catalogue.</p>

<p>Most likely this small piece of linen was meant to be a covering for
a table, or may be the chest of drawers in the vestry, and upon which
the vestments for the day were laid out for the celebrating priest to put
on. In the pattern there is evidently a strong liking for the gammadion&mdash;a
kind of figuration constructed out of modifications of the Greek
letter gamma. In England the gammadion became known as the “filfot,”
and seems to have been looked upon as a symbol for the name
Francis or Frances, and is of frequent occurrence in our national
monuments&mdash;especially in needlework&mdash;belonging to the 14th and 15th
centuries. From the presence of that large eight-petaled flower in this
cloth we are somewhat warranted in thinking that the same hand that
wrought the fine and curious frontal, <a href="#h-8709">No. 8709</a>, worked this, and that
her baptismal name was Frances.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This instructive piece deserves the attention of those who study
embroidery. The loom was geared in such a manner that the spaces
for the head, face, neck, and hands were left quite empty, so that they
might be filled in by the needle. But this was not all the hand had to
do; the architectural features of the canopy, its shading in red, the
nimb, and nicely floriated diapering all over the angel’s golden alb,
were put in by the needle.</p>

<p>The figures are well done, and all show the varieties of process then

stitches required for indicating the hair and features of the countenance
and indications of the fingers. Some of the dress was cut out of woven
cloth of gold and sewed on; other parts worked with the needle, as
were such accessories as books, instruments of martyrdom, and other
such emblems. The knight, probably the giver of the chasuble, is
meant to be indicated by his blazon, which is a shield <i>or</i> charged with
eight <i>torteaux</i> in orle, and this is surmounted by a golden helmet with
mantling, and a crest, consisting of golden horns fringed with four
<i>torteaux</i> each. The ground upon which the embroideries are set is

spokes upon a bright red field.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Notwithstanding the embroidery be somewhat coarse, like much of
the same kind of work at the period, it is so far valuable as it instructs
us how three methods were practised together on one piece. The
canvas ground was left bare at the faces and hands, so that the features
of the one and the joints of the other might be shown by appropriate
stitches in silk. Pieces of golden web, cut to the right size, were
applied for the upper garments of the figures, and the folds shaded by
hand in red silk, and the borders of the robe edged with a small cording,
while all the rest of the work was filled in with needlework. The
closely fitting scull-cap, but more especially the staff ending in a tau-cross,
indicate St. Anthony, but the female saint cannot be identified;
her long hair flowing about her shoulders signifies that she was a virgin,
and the green palm-branch in her right hand indicates that she underwent
martyrdom.</p>

Piece</span> of Embroidery, on canvas; ground, figured with
St. John the Baptist and St. John the Evangelist.
Rhenish, 16th century. 1 foot 4 inches square.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To the left is seen St. John the Baptist, clothed in a long garment
of camel-hair and his loins girt with a light-blue girdle, preaching
in the wilderness on the banks of the Jordan. In his left hand he holds
a clasped book, upon which rests the “Lamb of God,” and just over, a
flag, the white field of which is ensigned with a red cross; his upraised
right hand, with the first two fingers elevated as in the act of blessing,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
is pointed to the lamb. To the right we have St. John the Evangelist,
holding a cup in one hand, while with the other he makes the poisonous
drug in it harmless by a blessing.</p>

<p>The grounding has been filled in mostly with golden thread, but of
so poor a quality that the thin metal on it is scarcely discernible. In
both figures the whole of the person, the fleshes, as well as clothing,
are all done in woven white silk cut out, shaded, and featured in colours
by the brush, with some little needlework here and there upon the
garments and accessories. The figures of the saints are “applied;”
and one cannot but admire the effect which a few stitches of rich green
silk produce upon the canvas ground, while a piece of applied silk,
slightly shaded by the brush, is an admirable imitation of a rocky cliff.
The two tall trees and green garlands between them are telling in their
warm tones. Altogether this is a precious specimen of applied work,
and merits attention. It seems to have been the middle piece of a
banner used for processions, and may have once belonged to some church
at Cologne dedicated to the two SS. John.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Uprising from her grave, and amid rays of glory and an oblong or
elliptic aureole, the Virgin Mary is being wafted to heaven by four
angels, who are not, as of yore, vested in long close albs like deacons, but
in flowing garments so slit up as to show their naked arms, bare legs, and
lower thighs. Upon the empty tomb, from out of which are springing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
up lilies, is written “Assunta est;” and at one corner kneels the apostle
St. Thomas who, with head uplifted and both his arms outstretched, is
receiving from the mother of our Lord her girdle, which she is holding
in her hands and about to let drop down to him. “La Madonna della
cintola”&mdash;this subject&mdash;may often be met with in Italian, more especially
Florentine, art of the middle ages, and is closely linked with
the history of the fine old church of Prato, as we gather from Vasari,
in his “Vite dei Pittori,” t. i. p. 279, Firenze, 1846; and the English

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Like the valuable specimen of the needle described at <a href="#h-8358">No. 8358</a>, the
example before us served the purpose of covering the lectern in the
chancel at the celebration of the liturgy.</p>

<p>As in the usual representations of the Jesse-tree, the bust of each of
the thirteen figures is made to rest within a circular branch upon its
tip, where it sprouts out like a wide flower. At the top of this tree we
behold our Lord with His right hand uplifted in the act of benediction,
His left rested upon a mund, and, about His head a scroll inscribed
“Pax F(V)obis.” To the right is St. Peter&mdash;so inscribed&mdash;holding a
key; to the left, St. John, as a beardless youth&mdash;inscribed “S. Johnis;”
then St. Anderus (Andrew), with a cross saltire-wise; and St. Jacob
(James), with his pilgrim’s staff in hand, and on his large slouched hat
turned up in front he has two pilgrim-staves in saltire; St. Jacobi
(James the Less), with fuller’s bat; St. Simonus (Simon), beardless, with
a long knife or sword jagged or toothed like a saw; St. Thomas, with
his spear; St. Bartlyme (Bartholomew), with the flaying knife; St. Judas
Tadvs (Jude or Thaddeus), with a knotted club; St. Matheus (Matthew),
with a hatchet, and beardless; St. Philippe, with a cross bottony, and
beardless; St. Mathias, with a halbert. At bottom is marked, in blue
ink, 1574; but it may be fairly doubted if this date be the true one for
this embroidery, of which the style looks at least fifty years older.</p>

<p>This is another liturgical appliance, once so common everywhere,
and so often mentioned in English ecclesiastical documents, which has
now become a very great rarity. From the shred of the altar-cloth itself
to which it is sewed, that linen, with its fine diapering and its two blue
stripes, diapered, too, and vertically woven in, must have been of a
costly kind, and large enough to overspread the whole table of the altar,
so that this blue frontlet fell down in front. The Latin inscription, each
word parted by a wreath, from four parts of which shoot sprigs of
flowers, reads thus:&mdash;“O Gloriosum lumen ec(c)lesiarum funde preces
pro salute populorum.” The letters, as well as all the floral ornamentation
of this short prayer, are wrought in pieces of linen stitched on with
red thread; and below is a worsted parti-coloured fringe, 1¾ inches deep.

broad worsted threads stitched on with white thread; and the flowers,
all seeded and barbed, some white, some yellow, as if in accordance with

15th century. 9 feet 5½ inches by 4 feet 2½ inches.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This important piece of stitchery was never meant for a covering
to the table or upper part of the altar; it served as a frontal to it, and
was hung before, and at each corner of the altar so as to cover it and
its two sides down to the ground. From all its ornaments having an
armorial feeling about them, this elaborate piece of needlework would
seem to have been wrought by the hands of some noble lady, who
took the blazon of her house for its adornment. At the lower part, in
the middle, is a shield of arms <i>argent</i>, charged with two bars once <i>gules</i>;
high above, a star of eight points voided <i>gules</i>; below, a fleur-de-lis barred
<i>argent</i> and <i>gules</i>; at each of the four corners of the square a maneless
lion rampant barred <i>argent</i> and <i>gules</i>. To the right, on the same level,
a square filled in with fleurs-de-lis; then a square with birds and
beasts unknown to English heraldry: the birds, natant, have heads
of the deer kind, horned, and the beasts a beaked head with a single
arched horn coming out of the forehead with the point of the bow in
front; both birds and beasts are paled <i>argent</i> and <i>gules</i>. On the next
square are stars of eight points, and flowers with eight petals, within
quatrefoils all <i>argent</i>, upon a field (the netting) <i>gules</i>. The last square
is separated into three pales each charged with a flower-like ornament
alternately <i>argent</i> and <i>gules</i>. Above this square is another of net <i>gules</i>,
charged with four flowers <i>argent</i>; and, going to the left, we have a
square showing two bears combatant barred <i>argent</i> and <i>gules</i>; still to
the left, birds at rest, and stars alternating <i>argent</i> upon a square of net
<i>gules</i>. Next to this a large antelope tripping paled <i>argent</i> and <i>gules</i>;
then a square having lions rampant within lozenges with a four-petaled
flower at every point, all <i>argent</i>, on a field (of net) <i>gules</i>. Following
this is a large dog, maned and rampant barred <i>argent</i> and <i>gules</i>; to
this succeeds a square of net <i>gules</i> charged with lozenges, having over
each point a mascle, and within them stars of eight points all <i>argent</i>.
The last square to the left on this middle row is charged with a
heart-shaped ornament voided in the form of a fleur-de-lis, and put in
three piles of four with flowers between. The only other square<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
differing from those just noticed are the two charged with an animal of
the deer kind, with antlers quite straight. The narrow borders at the
sides are not the least curious parts of this interesting specimen; that
on the left hand is made up of a dog running after a bearded antelope,
which is confronted by a griffin so repeated as to fill up the whole line.
The border on the right hand is made up of the beast with the one
horn.</p>

Alb</span> of White Linen appareled at the cuffs, and before
and behind at the feet, with crimson and gold stuff
figured with animals and floriations of the looms of
Palermo. Sicilian, 14th century. 5 feet 7 inches long, 4 feet
across the shoulders, without the sleeves.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>For those curious in liturgical appliances this fine alb of the mediæval
period will be a valuable object of study, though perhaps not for
imitation in the way in which it is widened at the waist. Its large
opening at the neck&mdash;1 foot 4½ inches&mdash;is somewhat scalloped, but
without any slit down the front, or gatherings, or band. On each
shoulder, running down 1 foot 3¾ inches, is a narrow piece of crochet-work
inscribed in red letters with the names “<span class="smcap">Jesus</span>,” “<span class="smcap">Maria</span>.”
The full sleeves, from 1 foot 6 inches wide, are gradually narrowed to
6¼ inches at the end of the apparels at the cuffs, which are 4 inches
deep and edged with green linen tape. At the waist, where it is 3 feet
10 inches, it is made, by means of gatherings upon a gusset embroidered
with a cross-crosslet in red thread, to widen itself into 6 feet, or 12 feet
all round. Down the middle, before and behind, as far as the apparels,
is let in a narrow piece of crochet-work like that upon the shoulders,
but uninscribed. The two apparels at the feet&mdash;one before, the other
behind&mdash;vary in their dimensions, one measuring 1 foot 1 inch by 1 foot
1¾ inches, the other, which is made up of fragments, 1 foot by 11¾
inches. Very elaborate and freely designed is the heraldic pattern on
the rich stuff which forms the apparels. The ground is of silk,
now faded, but once a bright crimson; the figures, all in gold, are
an eagle in demi-vol, langued, with a ducal crown, not upon, but
over its head; above this is a mass of clouds with pencils of sun-rays
darting from beneath them all around; higher up again, a collared
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
hart lodged, with its park set between two large bell-shaped seeded
drooping flowers, beneath each of which is a dog collared and courant.
For English antiquaries, it may be interesting to know that upon the
mantle and kirtle in the monumental effigy of King Richard II, in
Westminster Abbey, the hart as well as the cloud with rays form
the pattern on those royal garments, and are well shown in the valuable
but unfinished “Monumental Effigies of Great Britain,” by the late
brothers Hollis. This alb is figured, but not well with regard to the
apparels, by Dr. Bock, in his “Geschichte der Liturgischen Gewänder
des Mittelalters,” 4 Lieferung, pl. iii, fig. 1.</p>

Part</span> of a large Piece of Needlework, done upon linen
in coloured worsteds, figured with a king and queen
seated together on a Gothic throne, and a young
princess sitting at the queen’s feet. All about are inscriptions.
German (?), 15th century. 5 feet 6½ inches by 3 feet 10 inches.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Wofully cut as this large work has been, enough remains to make
it very interesting. The king,&mdash;whose broad-toed shoes, as well as
the very little dog at his feet, will not escape notice,&mdash;holds a royal
sceptre in his left hand, and around his head runs a scroll bearing this
inscription, “Inclitus Rex Alfridus ex ytalia Pacis amator.” About the
head of the queen, which is wimpled, the scroll is written with, “Pia
Hildeswit Fundatrix Peniten (?), A<sup>o</sup>. M<sup>o</sup>. XII<sup>o</sup>.” Below the princess,
whose hair, as that of a maiden, falls all about her shoulders, and whose
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
diadem is not a royal one, nor jewelled like those worn by the king
and queen, runs a scroll bearing these words, “Albergissa Abbatissa.”
Just under the king, on a broad band, comes&mdash;“o. dāpnacionis (damnationis)
in &amp;.” At top, on a broad bright crimson ground, in large
yellow letters, we read&mdash;“v (ex voto?) hoc opus completum ē (est).”
From droppings of wax still upon it, this curious piece of needlework
must have been used somewhere about an altar&mdash;very likely as a sort of
reredos; and from the inscription, it would seem to have been wrought
as an ex voto offering.</p>

<p>The linen upon which this venerable specimen of embroidery is

Such parts of the design as were meant to be white are left uncovered
upon the linen, and the shading is indicated by brown lines. As such
early examples are scarce, this is a great curiosity. Dr. Bock has
figured it in his “Geschichte der Liturgischen Gewänder des Mittelalters,”

Frontal</span> to an Altar; ground, crimson; pattern,
sacred subjects and saints, some in gold, some in yellow
silk. Venetian, early 16th century. 6 feet 6 inches
by 2 feet 3½ inches.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This frontal is made out of pieces of woven orphreys, and by the
way in which those pieces are put together we know that they must
have been taken from old vestments, some of which had been much
used. It is composed of nine stripes or pales of broad orphrey-web;
and allowing for the two end pales being brought round the ends of the
altar when hung there, it would then present seven stripes or pales to
the eye. Looking at it thus, we find the first pale of crimson silk,
figured in yellow silk, with the B. V. Mary holding our Lord as an infant
on her lap, with the mund or terraqueous globe surmounted by a cross
in His right hand, amid a strap-like foliation; the next pale of crimson
silk is figured in gold, with a saint-bishop vested in alb, stole crossed
over his breast, and cope, and wearing jewelled gloves, with his pastoral
staff in his right hand. The third pale, in yellow silk upon a crimson
ground, presents us our Lord’s tomb, with soldiers watching it, and our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
Lord Himself uprising, with His right hand giving a blessing, and in His
left a banner, and by His side cherubic heads. The fourth pale at top
gives us the B. V. Mary and our infant Saviour in her arms, very
much worn away, and beneath, St. Peter with his keys, in gold upon
crimson. The other pales are but repetitions of the foregoing. Altogether,
this frontal, thread-bare as it is in places, is well worth the
attention of those who interest themselves in the history of Venetian
design, and the art of weaving.</p>

<p>We have on the first large pane a rose tree, bearing one red rose

by the red rose, two lions passant, face to face, langued and outlined in
gold thread; above the flower a royal crown <i>or</i>, and two small knots
<i>or</i>, and at each side a white rose slipped; over each unicorn a gold knot,
and a strawberry proper. Beneath this larger shield are three small
ones: the first, fretty <i>or</i>, and <i>vert</i> (but so managed that the field takes the
shape of strawberry leaves), charged with four true-love-knots <i>or</i>, and in
chief <i>vert</i>, a strawberry branch or wire <i>or</i>, bearing one fruit proper,
and one flower <i>argent</i>; the second shield gives us, on a field <i>azure</i>, and
within an orle of circles linked together on four sides by golden bands,
and charged with strawberry fruit, and leaf, and flower proper, and
alternating, a plume of Prince of Wales’s feathers <i>argent</i>, with the
quill of the middle feather marked red or <i>gules</i>, at each of the four
corners there is a true-love-knot in gold; the third small shield is a
series of circles outlined in gold, and filled in with quatrefoils outlined
green; below, on a large green pane, a white rose slipped, with grapes
and acorns; by its side, the capital letters, in gold, I and R, with a
strawberry and leaf close by each letter, and above all, and between two
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
love-knots, a regal crown. By the sides of this device are several
small panes, exhibiting fanciful patterns of flowers, &amp;c.: but in most of
them the true-love-knot as well as the strawberry plant, in one combination
or another, are the principal elements; and in one of the
squares or panes the ornamentation evidently affects the shape of the
capital letter S; upon the other side, with an orle of knots of different
kinds, is figured a mermaid on the sea, with a comb in one hand, and
on one side of this pane is shown a high-born dame, whose fan, seemingly
of feathers, is very conspicuous. Underneath the mermaid are
shown, upon a field <i>vert</i>, a man with a staff, amid four rabbits, each
with a strawberry-leaf in its mouth, and at each far corner a stag. As
on the other side, so here the larger squares are surrounded by smaller
ones displaying in their design true-love-knots, strawberries, acorns,
roses, white and red, and in one pane the combination, in a sort of net-work,
of the true-love-knot with the letter S, is very striking. In
Scotland several noble families, whether they spell their name Fraser
or Frazer, use, as a canting charge in their blazon, the frasier or strawberry,
leafed, flowered, and fructed proper; the buck, too, comes in
upon or about their armorial shields. And this may have been worked
by a member of that family.</p>

<p>This handsome cope, so very remarkable on account of its comparative
perfect preservation, is one of the most beautiful among the
several liturgic vestments of the olden period anywhere to be now found
in christendom. If by all lovers of mediæval antiquity it will be looked
upon as so valuable a specimen in art of its kind and time, for every
Englishman it ought to have a double interest, showing, as it does, such
a splendid and instructive example of the “Opus Anglicum,” or English
work, which won for itself so wide a fame, and was so eagerly sought
after throughout the whole of Europe during the middle ages.</p>

<p>Beginning with the middle of this cope, we have, at the lowermost
part, St. Michael overcoming Satan; suggested by those verses of
St. John, “And there was a great battle in heaven, Michael and his
angels fought with the dragon, and the dragon fought and his angels;
... and that great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, who is
called the Devil and Satan,” &amp;c.&mdash;Rev. xii. 7, 9, to which may be
added the words of the English Golden Legend: “The fourth
victorye is that that tharchaungell Mychaell shal have of Antecryst
whan he shall flee hym. Than Michaell the grete prynce shall aryse,
as it is sayd Danielis xii, He shall aryse for them that ben chosen as
an helper and a protectour and shall strongely stande ayenst Antecryst
... and at the last he (Antichrist) shall mount upon the mount of
Olyvete, and whan he shall be ... entred in to that place where our
Lorde ascended Mychaell shall come and shall flee hym, of whiche
victorye is understonden after saynt Gregorye that whyche is sayd in
thapocalipsis, the batayll is made in heven,” (fol. cclxx. b.). As he
tramples upon the writhing demon, the archangel, barefoot, and clad
in golden garments, and wearing wings of gold and silver feathers,
thrusts down his throat and out through his neck a lance, the shaft
of which is tipped with a golden cross crosslet, while from his left arm
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
he lets down an <i>azure</i> shield blazoned with a silver cross. The next
quatrefoil above this one is filled in with the Crucifixion. Here the
Blessed Virgin Mary is arrayed in a green tunic, and a golden
mantle lined with vair or costly white fur, and her head is kerchiefed,
and her uplifted hands are sorrowfully clasped; St. John&mdash;whose dress
is all of gold&mdash;with a mournful look, is on the left, at the foot of the
cross upon which the Saviour, wrought all in silver&mdash;a most unusual
thing,&mdash;with a cloth of gold wrapped about His loins, is fastened by
three, not four, nails. The way in which the ribs are shown and the
chest thrown up in the person of our Lord is quite after old English
feelings on the subject. In the book of sermons called the “Festival”
it is said, with strong emphasis, how “Cristes body was drawen on the
crosse as a skyn of parchement on a harow, so that all hys bonys myght
be tolde,” fol. xxxiii. In the highest quatrefoil of all is figured the
Redeemer uprisen, crowned as a king and seated on a cushioned
throne. Resting upon His knee, and steadied by His left hand, is the
mund or ball representing the earth&mdash;the world. Curiously enough,
this mund is distinguished into three parts, of which the larger one&mdash;an
upper horizontal hemicycle&mdash;is coloured crimson (now faded to a
brownish tint), but the lower hemicycle is divided vertically in two, of
which one portion is coloured green, the other white or silvered. The
likelihood is, that such markings were meant to show the then only
known three parts of our globe; for if the elements were hereon intended,
there would have been four quarters&mdash;fire, water, earth, and
heaven; instead, too, of the upper half being crimsoned, it would have
been tinted, like the heavens, blue. Furthermore, the symbolism of
those days would put, as we here see, this mund under the sovereign
hand of the Saviour, as setting forth the Psalmist’s words, “The earth
is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof, the world and all that dwell
therein;” while its round shape&mdash;itself the emblem of endlessness&mdash;must
naturally bring to mind that everlasting Being&mdash;the Alpha and the
Omega spoken of in the Apocalypse&mdash;the beginning and the end, Who
is and Who was, and Who is to come&mdash;the Almighty. Stretching forth
His right arm, with His thumb and first two fingers upraised&mdash;emblem
of one God in three persons&mdash;He is giving His blessing to His mother.
Clothed in a green tunic, over which falls a golden mantle lined with
vair or white fur, she is seated on the throne beside Him, with hands
upraised in prayer. It ought not to be overlooked, that while the Blessed
Virgin Mary wears ornamented shoes, our Lord, like His messengers,
the angels and apostles, is barefoot. To show that as He had said to
those whom He sent before His face, that they were to carry neither
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
purse, nor scrip, nor shoes, so therefore, is He Himself here and elsewhere
figured shoeless. Though already in heaven, still, out of reverence
towards Him, the head of His mother is kerchiefed, as it would
have been were she yet on earth and present at the sacred liturgy. John
Beleth, an Englishman, who, in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1162, a short century before this cope
was worked, wrote a book upon the Church Ritual, lays it down as an
unbending rule that, while men are to hear the Gospel bare-headed, all
women, whatever be their age, rank, or condition, must never be uncovered,
and if a young maiden be so her mother or any other female
ought to cast a cloth of some sort over her head;&mdash;“Viri, itaque ...
aperto capite Evangelium audire debent.... Mulieres vero debent
audire Evangelium tecto et velato capite etiamsi sit virgo, propter pomum
vetitum. Et si eveniat ut virgo capite sit aperto, ut velamen non habeat,
necesse est, ut mater, aut quævis alia mulier capiti ejus pannum vel
simile quippiam imponat.” Divin. Offic. Explic. c. xxxix. p. 507.</p>

<p>The next two subjects now to be described are&mdash;one, that on the
right hand, the death of the Blessed Virgin Mary; the other, to the
left, her burial. To fully understand the traditionary treatment
of both, it would be well to give the words of Caxton’s English
translation of the “Golden Legend,” from the edition “emprynted at
London, in Fletestrete at y<sup>e</sup> sygne of y<sup>e</sup> Sonne, by Wynkyn de Worde,
in y<sup>e</sup> yere of our Lorde <span class="allsmcap">M.CCCCXVII</span>,” a scarce and costly work not within
easy reach. “We fynde in a booke sente to saynt Johan the evangelys,
or elles the boke whiche is sayd to be apocryphum ... in what maner the
Assumpcyon of the blessyd vyrgyn saynt Marye was made ... upon a daye
whan all the apostles were spradde through the worlde in prechynge,
the gloryous vyrgyne was gretely esprysed and enbraced wyth desyre to
be wyth her sone Ihesu Cryste ... and an aungell came tofore her with
grete lyghte and salewed her honourably as the mother of his Lorde,
sayenge, All hayle blessyd Marie.... Loo here is a bowe of
palme of paradyse, lady, ... whiche thou shalte commaunde
to be borne tofore thy bere, for thy soule shall be taken from thy
body the thyrde daye nexte folowynge; and thy Sone abydeth thee
His honourable moder.... All the apostles shall assemble this daye to
thee and shall make to thee noble exequyes at thy passynge, and in the
presence of theym all thou shalte gyve up thy spyryte. For he that
broughte the prophete (Habacuc) by an heer from Judee to Babylon
(Daniel xiv. 35, according to the Vulgate) may without doubte sodeynly
in an houre brynge the apostles to thee.... And it happened as Saynt
Johan the euangelyst preched in Ephesym the heven sodeynly thondred
and a whyte cloude toke hym up and brought hym tofore the gate of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
the blessyd vyrgyne Marye at Jerusalem (who) sayd to hym, ... Loo I
am called of thy mayster and my God, ... I have herde saye that the Jewes
have made a counseyll and sayd, let us abyde brethren unto the tyme
that she that bare Jhesu Crist be deed, and thenne incontynente we
shall take her body and shall caste it in to the fyre and brenne it. Thou
therefore take this palme and bere it tofore the bere whan ye shall bere
my body to the sepulcre. Than sayd Johan, O wolde God that all
my brethren the apostles were here that we myght make thyn exequyes
covenable as it hoveth and is dygne and worthy. And as he sayd that,
all the apostles were ravysshed with cloudes from the places where they
preched and were brought tofore the dore of the blessyd vyrgyn Mary....
And aboute the thyrde houre of the nyght Jhesu Crist came with
swete melodye and songe with the ordre of aungelles.... Fyrst Jhesu
Crist began to saye, Come my chosen and I shall set thee in my sete ...
come fro Lybane my spouse. Come from Lybane. Come thou shalte be
crowned. And she sayd I come, for in the begynnynge of the booke
it is wryten of me that I sholde doo thy wyll, for my spyryte hath joyed
in thee the God of helth; and thus in the mornynge the soule yssued out
of the body and fledde up in the armes of her sone.... And than the
apostles toke the body honourably and layde it on the bere.&mdash;And
than Peter and Paule lyfte up the bere, and Peter began to synge
and saye Israhell is yssued out of Egypt, and the other apostles folowed
hym in the same songe, and our Lorde covered the bere and the apostles
with a clowde, so that they were not seen but the voyce of them was
onely herde, and the aungelles were with the apostles syngynge, and
than all the people was moved with that swete melodye, and yssued out
of the cyte and enquyred what it was.&mdash;And than there were some that
sayd that Marye suche a woman was deed, and the dyscyples of her
sone Jhesu Crist bare her, and made suche melodye. And thenne ranne
they to armes and they warned eche other sayenge, Come and let us
slee all the dysciples and let us brenne the body of her that bare this
traytoure. And whan the prynce of prestes sawe that he was all
abashed and, full of angre and wrath sayd, Loo, here the tabernacle of
hym that hath troubled us, and our lygnage, beholde what glorye he
now receyveth, and in the saynge so he layde his hondes on the bere
wyllynge to turne it and overthrowe it to the grounde. Than
sodeynly bothe his hondes wexed drye and cleved to the bere so
that he henge by the hondes on the bere and was sore tormented
and wepte and brayed. And the aungelles ... blynded all the other
people that they sawe no thynge. And the prynce of prestes sayd,
saynt Peter despyse not me in this trybulacyon, and I praye thee to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
praye for me to our Lorde.&mdash;And saynt Peter sayd to hym&mdash;Kysse the
bere and saye I byleve in God Jhesu Crist. And whan he had so sayd
he was anone all hole perfyghtly.&mdash;And thenne the apostles bare Mary
unto the monument (in the Vale of Josaphat outside Jerusalem) and
satte by it lyke as oure Lord had commaunded. And at the thyrde
daye ... the soule came agayne to the body of Marye and yssued
gloryously out of the tombe, and thus was receyved in the hevenly
chaumbre, and a grete company of aungelles with her; and saynt
Thomas was not there; and whan he came he wolde not byleve
this; and anone the gyrdell with whiche her body was gyrde came to
hym fro the ayre, whiche he receyved, and therby he understode
that she was assumpte into heven; and all this it here to fore is sayd
and called apocryphum,” &amp;c. ff. ccxvi, &amp;c.</p>

<p>With this key we may easily unlock what, otherwise, would lie
hidden, not only about the coronation, but, in an especial manner, the
death and burial, as here figured, of the Blessed Virgin Mary; the former
of these two is thus represented on the right hand side. In her own
small house by the foot of Mount Sion, at Jerusalem, is Christ’s mother
on her dying bed. Four only of the apostles&mdash;there would not have
been room enough for showing more in the quatrefoil&mdash;are standing by
the couch upon which she lies, dressed in a silver tunic almost wholly
overspread with a coverlet of gold; she is bolstered up by a deep purple
golden fretted pillow. St. Peter is holding up her head, while by her
side stands St. Paul, clad, like St. Peter, in a green tunic and a golden
mantle; then St. Matthew, in a blue tunic and a mantle of gold,
holding in the left hand his Gospel, which begins with the generation
of our Lord as man, and the pedigree of Mary His mother; while,
in front of them, stands John, arrayed in a shaded light-purple tunic,
youthful in look, and whose auburn hair is in so strong a contrast to the
hoary locks of his brethren. On the left-hand side we have her burial.
Stretched full-length upon a bier, over which is thrown a pall of green
shot with yellow, lies the Virgin Mary, her hair hanging loose from her
head. St. Peter, known by his keys, St. Paul, by his uplifted sword,
are carrying on their shoulders one end of the bier, in front; behind,
in the same office, are St. Andrew bringing his cross with him, and
some other apostle as his fellow. After them walks St. Thomas, who,
with both his uplifted hands, is catching the girdle as it drops to him
from above, where, in the skies, her soul, in the shape of a little child,
is seen standing upright with clasped hands, within a large flowing sheet
held by two angels who have come from heaven to fetch it thither.
Right before the funeral procession is a small Jew, who holds in one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
hand a scabbard, and with the other is unsheathing his weapon. By the
side of the bier stand two other Jews also small in size&mdash;one, the high
priest. One of them has both his arms, the priest but one, all twisted
and shrunken, stretched forward on the bier, as if they wanted to upset
it; while the latter holds in one of his wasted hands the green bough
of the palm-tree, put into it by St. John.</p>

<p>With regard to St. Thomas and the girdle, this cope, if not the
earliest, is among the earlier works upon which that part of the legend
is figured, though after a somewhat different manner to the one followed
in Italy, where, as is evident from several specimens, in this collection,
it found such favour.</p>

<p>Below the burial, we have our Lord in the garden, signified by the
two trees (John xx. 17). Still wearing a green crown of thorns, and
arrayed in a golden mantle, our Lord in His left hand holds the banner
of the resurrection, and with His right bestows His benediction on the
kneeling Magdalene, who is wimpled, and wears a mantle of green
shot yellow, over a light purple tunic. Below, but outside the quatrefoil,
is a layman clad in gold upon his knees, and holding a long narrow
scroll, bearing words which cannot now be satisfactorily read. Lowermost
of all we see the apostle St. Philip with a book in the left hand,
but upon the right, muffled in a large towel wrought in silver, three
loaves of bread, done partially in gold, piled up one on the other, in
reference to our Lord’s words (John vi. 5), before the miracle of
feeding the five thousand. At the left is St. Bartholomew holding
a book in one hand, in the other the flaying knife. A little above him,
St. Peter with his two keys, one gold, the other silver; and somewhat
under him, to the right, is St. Andrew with his cross. On the other
side of St. Michael and the dragon is St. James the Greater&mdash;sometimes
called of Compostella, because he lies buried in that Spanish
city&mdash;with a book in one hand, and in the other a staff, and slung
from his wrist a wallet, both emblems of pilgrimage to his shrine in
Galicia. In the next quatrefoil above stands St. Paul with his usual
sword, emblem alike of his martyrdom, and of the Spirit, which is the
word of God (Ephes. vi. 17), and a book; lower, to the right, St.
Thomas with his lance of martyrdom and a book; and still further to
the right, St. James the Less with a book and the club from which he
received his death-stroke (Eusebius, book ii. c. 23). Just above is our
Saviour clad in a golden tunic, and carrying a staff overcoming the
unbelief of St. Thomas. Upon his knees that apostle feels, with his
right hand held by the Redeemer, the spear-wound in His side (John
xx. 27).</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span></p>
<p>As at the left hand, so here, quite outside the sacred history on the
cope, we have the figure of an individual probably living at the time the
vestment was wrought. The dress of the other shows him to be a layman;
by the shaven crown upon his head, this person must have been
a cleric of some sort: but whether monk, friar, or secular we cannot
tell, as his gown has become quite bare, so that we see nothing now but
the lower canvas with the lines drawn in black for the shading of the
folds. Like his fellow over against him, this churchman holds up a
scroll bearing words which can no longer be read.</p>

<p>When new this cope could show, written in tall gold letters more
than an inch high, an inscription now cut up and lost, as the unbroken
word “Ne” on one of its shreds, and a solitary “V” on another, are
all that remains of it, the first on the lower right side; the second, in
the like place, to the left. Though so short, the Latin word leads us
to think that it was the beginning of the anthem to the seven penitential
psalms, “<i>Ne</i> reminiscaris, Domine, delicta nostra, <i>v</i>el parentum
nostrorum; neque <i>v</i>indictam sumas de peccatis nostris,” a suitable
prayer for a liturgical garment, upon which the mercies of the Great
Atonement are so well set forth in the Crucifixion, the overthrow of
Antichrist, and the crowning of the saints in heaven.</p>

<p>In its original state it could give us, not, as now, only eight apostles,
but their whole number. Even as yet the patches on the right-hand
side afford us three of the missing heads, while another patch to the left
shows us the hand with a book, belonging to the fourth. The lower
part of this vestment has been sadly cut away, and reshaped with shreds
from itself; and perhaps at such a time were added its present heraldic
orphrey, morse, and border, perhaps some fifty years after the embroidering
of the other portions of this invaluable and matchless specimen
of the far-famed “Opus Anglicum,” or English needlework.</p>

<p>The early writers throughout Christendom, Greek as well as Latin,
distinguished “nine choirs” of angels, or three great hierarchies, in the
upper of which were the “cherubim, or seraphim, and thrones;”
in the middle one, the “dominations, virtues, and powers;” in the
lower hierarchy, the “principalities, angels, and archangels.” Now,
while looking at the rather large number of angels figured here, we shall
find that this division into three parts, each part again containing other
three, has been accurately observed. Led a good way by Ezekiel (i.),
but not following that prophet step by step, our mediæval draughtsmen
found out for themselves a certain angel form. To this they gave a
human shape having but one head, and that of a comely youth,
clothing him with six wings, as Isaias told (vi. 2) of the seraphim,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
and in place of the calf’s cloven hoofs, they made it with the feet
of man; instead of its body being full of eyes, this feature is not unoften
to be perceived upon the wings, but oftenest those wings themselves
are composed of the bright-eyed feathers borrowed from the peacock’s
tail.</p>

<p>Those eight angels standing upon wheels, and so placed that they
are everywhere by those quatrefoils wherein our Lord’s person comes,
may be taken to represent the upper hierarchy of the angelic host;
those other angels&mdash;and two of them only are entire&mdash;not upon wheels,
and far away from our Lord, one of the perfect ones under St. Peter,
the other under St. Paul, no doubt belong to the second hierarchy;
while those two having but one, not three, pair of wings, the first
under the death, the other under the burial of the Virgin, both of them
holding up golden crowns, one in each hand, represent, we may presume,
the lowest of the three hierarchies. All of them, like our Lord
and His apostles, are barefoot. All of them have their hands uplifted
in prayer.</p>

<p>For every lover of English heraldic studies this cope, so plentifully
blazoned with armorial bearings, will have an especial value, equal to that
belonging to many an ancient roll of arms. To begin with its orphrey:
that broad band may, in regard to its shields, be distinguished into three
parts, one that falls immediately about the neck of the cleric wearing
this vestment, and the other two portions right and left. In this first
or middle piece the shields, four in number, are of a round shape, but,
unlike the square ones, through both the other two side portions, are
not set upon squares alternately green and crimson (faded to brown) as
are the quatrefoils on the body of the cope. Taking this centre-piece
first, to the left we have&mdash;</p>

<p>6. Checky <i>azure</i> and <i>or</i>, a chevron <i>ermine</i>. <span class="smcap">Warwick.</span></p>

<p>7. Quarterly 1 and 4 <i>gules</i>, a three-towered castle <i>or</i>; 2 and 3 <i>argent</i>,
a lion rampant <i>azure</i>. <span class="smcap">Castile and Leon.</span></p>

<p>8. Vair <i>or</i> and <i>gules</i>, within a bordure <i>azure</i>, charged with sixteen
horse-shoes <i>argent</i>. <span class="smcap">Ferrers.</span></p>

<p>9. <i>Azure</i>, three barnacles <i>or</i>, on a chief <i>ermine</i> a demi-lion rampant
<i>gules</i>. <span class="smcap">Geneville.</span></p>

<p>These four shields are round, as was said before, and upon a green
ground, having nothing besides upon it. All the rest composing this
orphrey are squares of the diamond form, and put upon a grounding
alternately crimson and green; on the crimson are two peacocks and
two swans in gold; on the green, four stars of eight rays in gold voided
crimson. Now, beginning at the furthermost left side, we see these
blazons:&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span></p>

<p>Just below the two middle shields are four nicely-formed loops,
through which might be buttoned on to the cope the moveable hood&mdash;or
different hoods, according to the festival, and figured with the
subject of the feast&mdash;now lost. On the other edge of the orphrey, to
the left, are seen other three loops, like the former, made of thick gold
cord, by which was made fast the morse that is also blazoned with
ten coats, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>Gules</i>, a large six-pointed star <i>argent</i> voided with another star
<i>azure</i> voided <i>argent</i> voided <i>gules</i>, between four cross-crosslets <i>or</i>.</p>

in the morse are placed.</p>

<p>On the narrow band, at the hem, the same alternation of green and
crimson squares, as a ground for the small diamond-shaped shields, is
observed, as in the orphrey; and the blazons are, beginning at the left-hand
side:&mdash;</p>

<p>Besides their heraldry, squares upon which are shown swans and
peacocks wrought at each corner, afford, in those birds, objects of
much curious interest for every lover of mediæval symbolism under its
various phases.</p>

<p>In the symbolism of those times, the star and the crescent, the
peacock and the swan, had, each of them, its own several figurative
meanings. By the first of these emblems was to be understood,
according to the words, in Numbers xxiv. 17, of Balaam’s prophecy,&mdash;“a
star shall arise out of Jacob,”&mdash;our Saviour, who says of His
divine self, Apocalypse xxii. 16, “I am the bright and morning star.”
By inference, the star not only symbolized our Lord Himself, but His
Gospel&mdash;Christianity&mdash;in contradistinction to Mahometanism, against
which the crusades had been but lately carried on. The star of Bethlehem,
too, was thus also brought before the mind with all its associated
ideas of the Holy Land.</p>

<p>The crescent moon, on the shields with the Holy Lamb, represents
the Church, for the reason that small at first, but getting her light from
the true Sun of justice, our Lord, she every day grows larger, and at
the end of time, when all shall believe in her, will at last be in her full
brightness. This symbolism is set forth, at some length, by Petrus
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
Capuanus as quoted by Dom (now Cardinal) Pitra in his valuable
“Spicilegium Solesmense,” t. ii. 66. But for an English mediæval
authority on the point, we may cite our own Alexander Neckam, born
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1157 at St. Albans, and who had as a foster-brother King Richard
of the Lion-Heart. In his curious work, “De Naturis Rerum,” not long
since printed for the first time, and published by the authority of Her
Majesty’s treasury, under the direction of the Master of the Rolls,
Neckam thus writes:&mdash;“Per solem item Christus, verus sol justiciæ
plerumque intelligitur; per lunam autem ecclesia, vel quæcunque fidelis
anima. Sicut autem luna beneficium lucis a sole mendicat, ita et fidelis
anima a Christo qui est lux vera.” P. 53.</p>

<p>Not always was the peacock taken to be the unmitigated emblem
of pride and foolish vanity. Osmont the cleric, in his “Volucraire, or
Book of Birds,” after noticing its scream instead of song, its serpent-like
shape of head that it carries so haughtily, but lowers quite abashed as it
catches a glimpse at its ugly feet, and its garish plumage with the many
bright-eyed freckles on its fan-like tail which it loves to unfold for
admiration, draws these comparisons. As the peacock affrights us by
its cry, so does the preacher, when he thunders against sin startle us
into a hatred of it; if the step of the bird be so full of majesty, with
what steadiness ought a true Christian fearlessly tread his narrow path.
A man may perhaps find a happiness, nay, show a pride in the conviction
of having done a good deed, perhaps may sometimes therefore
carry his head a trifle high, and, strutting like the peacock, parade his
pious works to catch the world’s applause; as soon as he looks into
Holy Writ and there learns the weakness, lowliness, of his own origin,
he too droops his head in all humility. Those eye-speckled feathers in
its plumage warn him that never too often can he have his eyes wide
open, and gaze inwardly upon his own heart and know its secret
workings. Thus spoke an Anglo-Norman writer.</p>

<p>About the swan an Englishman, our Alexander Neckam, says:&mdash;“Quid
quod cygnus in ætate tenella fusco colore vestitus esse videtur,
qui postmodum in intentissimum candorem mutatur? Sic nonnulli
caligine peccatorum prius obfuscati, postea candoris innocentiæ veste
spirituali decorantur.”&mdash;<i>De Naturis Rerum</i>, p. 101. Here our countryman
hands us the key to the symbolic appearance of the swan upon this
liturgical garment; for, as while a cygnet, its feathers are always of a
dusky hue, but when the bird has grown up its plumage changes into
the most intensely white, just so, some people who are at first darkened
with the blackness of sin, in after days become adorned with the garb of
white innocence.</p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
<p>Besides their ecclesiastical meanings these same symbols had belonging
to them a secular significance. Found upon a piece of stuff
quite apart from that of the cope itself, and worked for the adornment
of that fine vestment after a lapse of many years, made up too of an
ornamentation the whole of which is heraldic and thus bringing to mind
worldly knights and their blazons and its age’s chivalry, it is easy to find
out for it an adaptation to the chivalric notions and customs of those
times. The Bethlehem star overtopping the Islam badge of the crescent
moon showed forth the wishes of every one who had been or meant to be
a crusader, or rather more, not merely of our men at arms but of every
true believer throughout Christendom whose untiring prayers were that
the Holy Land might be wrested from the iron hand of the Mahometan.
At great national festivities and solemn gatherings of the aristocracy,
not the young knight alone then newly girt, but the grey-haired warrior
would often, in that noble presence, bind himself by vow to do some
deed of daring, and swore it to heaven, and the swan, the pheasant, or
the peacock as the bird of his choice, was brought with a flourish of
trumpets, and amid a crowd of stately knights waiting on a bevy of fair
young ladies, and set before him. This sounds odd at this time of day;
not so did it in mediæval times, when those birds were looked upon
with favour on account of the majestic gracefulness of their shape, or
the sparkling beauty of their plumage. It must not be forgotten that
this orphrey was blazoned by English hands in England, and while all
the stirring doings of our first Edward were yet fresh in our people’s
remembrance. That king had been and fought in the Holy Land
against the Saracens. At his bidding, towards the end of life, a scene
remarkable even in that period of royal festive magnificence, took
place, when he himself, in the year 1306, girded his son, afterwards
Edward II, with the military belt in the palace of Westminster, and
then sent him to bestow the same knightly honour, in the church of
that abbey, upon the three hundred young sons of the nobility, who had
been gathered from all parts of the kingdom to be his companions in
the splendours of the day. But that grand function was brought to an
end by a most curious yet interesting act; to the joyous sounds of minstrelsy
came forwards a procession, bearing along a pair of swans confined
in a net, the meshes of which were made of cords fashioned like reeds
and wrought of gold. These birds were set in solemn pomp before the
king; and there and then Edward swore by the God in heaven and the
swans that he would go forth and wage war against the Scots: Matthew
Westminster, p. 454. No wonder, then, that along with the star and
crescent we find the knightly swan and peacock mingled in the heraldry
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
of the highest families in England, wrought upon a work from English
hands, during the fourteenth century. A long hundred years after this
elaborate orphrey was worked we find that Dan John Lydgate, monk of
Bury St. Edmund’s, in his poem called “All stant in chaunge like a mydsomer
Rose,” upon the fickleness of all earthly things, while singing of
this life’s fading vanities, counts among them&mdash;</p>

<p>To the wild but poetic legend of the swan and his descendants, we have
already alluded in our Introduction.</p>

<p>A word or two now upon the needlework, how it was done, and a
certain at present unused mechanical appliance to it after it was wrought,
so observable upon this vestment, lending its figures more effect, and
giving it, as a teaching example of embroidery, much more value than
any foreign piece in this numerous collection.</p>

<p>Looking well into this fine specimen of the English needle, we find
that, for the human face, all over it, the first stitches were begun in the
centre of the cheek, and worked in circular, not straight lines, into
which, however, after the middle had been made, they fell, and were so
carried on through the rest of the fleshes. After the whole figure had
thus been wrought; then with a little thin iron rod ending in a small
bulb or smooth knob slightly heated, were pressed down those spots upon
the faces worked in circular lines, as well as that deep wide dimple in
the throat especially of an aged person. By the hollows thus lastingly
sunk, a play of light and shadow is brought out that, at a short distance,
lends to the portion so treated a look of being done in low relief. Upon
the slightly-clothed person of our Lord this same process is followed in
a way that tells remarkably well; and the chest with the upper part of
the pelvis in the figure of our Saviour overcoming Thomas’s unbelief,
shows a noteworthy example of the mediæval knowledge of external
anatomy.</p>

<p>We must not, however, hide from ourselves the fact that the edges,
though so broad and blunt, given by such a use of the hot iron to parts
of an embroidery, expose it somewhat to the danger of being worn out
more in those than other portions which soon betray the damage by
their thread-bare dingy look, as is the case in the example just cited.</p>

<p>The method for filling in the quatrefoils, as well as working much
of the drapery on the figures, is remarkable for being done in a long
zigzag diaper-pattern, and after the manner called in ancient inventories,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
“opus plumarium,” from the way the stitches overlie each other
like the feathers on a bird.</p>

<p>The stitchery on the armorial bearings is the same as that now
followed in so many trifling things worked in wool.</p>

<p>The canvas for every part of this cope is of the very finest sort; but
oddly enough, its crimson canvas lining is thick and coarse. What
constituted, then, the characteristics of the “opus Anglicum,” or
English work, in mediæval embroidery were, first, the beginning of the
stitchery in certain parts of the human figure&mdash;the face especially&mdash;in
circular lines winding close together round and round; and, in the
second place, the sinking of those same portions into permanent hollows
by the use of a hot iron.</p>

<p>A word or two now about the history of this fine cope.</p>

<p>In olden days not a town, hardly a single parish, throughout England,
but had in it one or more pious associations called “gilds,” some of
which could show the noblest amongst the layfolks, men and women,
and the most distinguished of the clergy in the kingdom, set down upon
the roll of its brotherhood, which often grew up into great wealth.
Each of these gilds had, usually in its parish church, a chapel, or at
least an altar of its own, where, for its peculiar service, it kept one if
not several priests and clerics, provided, too, with every needful liturgical
appliance, articles of which were frequently the spontaneous
offering of individual brothers, who sometimes clubbed together for the
purpose of thus making their joint gift more splendid. Now it is most
remarkable that upon this cope, and quite apart from the sacred story
on it, we have two figures, that to the left, pranked out in the gay
attire of some rich layman; on the right, the other, who must be an
ecclesiastic from the tonsure on his head; each bears an inscribed scroll
in his hand, and both are in the posture of suppliants making offerings.
This cleric and this layman may have been akin to one another, brothers,
too, of the same gild for which they at their joint cost got this cope
worked and gave to it. But where was this gild itself?</p>

<p>Among the foremost of our provincial cities once was reckoned
Coventry. Its Corpus Christi plays or mysteries, illustrated by this
embroidery, enjoyed such a wide-spread fame that for the whole eight
days of their performance, every year, they drew crowds of the highest
and the gentlest of the land far and near, as the “Paston Letters”
testify, to see them; its gild was of such repute that our nobility&mdash;lords
and ladies&mdash;our kings and queens, did not think it anywise
beneath their high estate to be enrolled among its brotherhood.
Besides many other authorities, we have one in that splendid piece
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
of English tapestry&mdash;figured with Henry VI, Cardinal Beaufort,
Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, and other courtiers, on the left
or men’s side, and on the women’s, Queen Margaret, the Duchess
of Buckingham, and other ladies, most of them on their knees, and all
hearing mass&mdash;still hanging on the wall of the dining hall of St. Mary’s
gild, of which that king, with his queen and all his court became
members; and at whose altar, as brethren, they heard their service, on
some Sunday, or high festival, which they spent at Coventry. Taking
this old city as a centre, with a radius of no great length, we may
draw a circle on the map which will enclose Tamworth, tower and
town, Chartly Castle, Warwick, Charlcote, Althorp, &amp;c. where the
once great houses of Ferrers, Beauchamp, Lucy, and Spencer held, and
some of them yet hold, large estates; and from being the owners of broad
lands in its neighbourhood, their lords would, in accordance with the
religious feeling of those times, become brothers of the famous gild of
Coventry; and on account of their high rank, find their arms emblazoned
upon the vestments belonging to their fraternity. That such
a pious queen as the gentle Eleanor, our First Edward’s first wife, who
died <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1290, should have, in her lifetime, become a sister, and by
her bounties made herself to be gratefully remembered after death, is
very likely, so that we may with ease account for her shield&mdash;Castile
and Leon&mdash;as well as for the shields of the other great families we see
upon the orphrey, being wrought there as a testimonial that, while, like
many others, they were members, they also had been munificent benefactors
to the association. A remembrance of brotherhood for those
others equally noble, but less generous in their benefactions, may be
read in those smaller shields upon the narrow hem going along the lower
border of this vestment. The whole of it must have taken a long, long
time in the doing; and the probability is that it was worked by the
nuns of some convent which stood in or near Coventry.</p>

<p>Upon the banks of the Thames, at Isleworth, near London, in the
year 1414, Henry V. built, and munificently endowed, a monastery to
be called “Syon,” for nuns of St. Bridget’s order. Among the earliest
friends of this new house was a Master Thomas Graunt, an official in
one of the ecclesiastical courts of the kingdom. In the Syon nuns’
martyrologium&mdash;a valuable MS. lately bought by the British Museum&mdash;this
churchman is gratefully recorded as the giver to their convent of
several precious ornaments, of which this very cope seemingly is one.
It was the custom for a gild, or religious body, to bestow some rich
church vestment upon an ecclesiastical advocate who had befriended
it by his pleadings before the tribunals, and thus to convey their thanks
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
to him along with his fee. After such a fashion this cope could have
easily found its way, through Dr. Graunt, from Warwickshire to Middlesex.
At the beginning of Elizabeth’s reign it went along with the
nuns as they wandered in an unbroken body through Flanders, France,
and Portugal, where they halted. About sixty years ago it came back
again from Lisbon to England, and has found a lasting home in the
South Kensington Museum.</p>

Pieces</span> of Tapestry Hanging, figured with poetic
pastoral scenes. Flemish, perhaps wrought at
Audenaerde, in the first half of the 16th century.
29 feet 4 inches by 11 feet.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Soon after the early part of the 16th century, there sprang up
throughout Europe a liking for pastoral literature as seen in Virgil’s
eclogues: poets sung their dreams of the bliss to be found in rustic
life, in which sports and pastimes, amid well-dressed revelry and music,
with nought of toil or drudgery belonging to it, formed the yearly
round; and in summer tide, nobles and their ladies loved to rove the
woods and fields, and play at gentle shepherdism. How such frolics
were carried out we learn from the tapestry before us, which, in many
of its features, is near akin to those low reliefs of the same subject that
adorn the walls in the court-yard of the curious and elaborately ornamented
Hotel de Bourgtheroud, at Rouen.</p>

<p>At the left-hand side, lying on a flowery bank, is a gentleman shepherd,
whose broad-toed shoes and thick cloth leggings, fastened round
the knees and about the ancles, are rather conspicuous. On the brim
of his large round white hat is a sort of square ticket, coloured.
From his waist hangs a white satchel, bearing outside various appliances,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
such as countrymen want. Over him stands, with a tall spud in her
hands, a youthful lady dressed in a scarlet robe, and wearing her satchel
by her side, a thin gauze cap, not a hat, is on her head, and with her
hand upraised she seems to be giving emphasis to what she says to her
friend upon the ground.</p>

<p>In the middle of this piece is a group, consisting of four characters,
all of whom are playing at some game of forfeits. A young lady clad
in blue satin, with the usual rustic pouch slung at her side, is sitting on
the flowery grass, with her hands on the shoulders of a youth at her
feet, and hiding his face in her lap. Standing over him and about
to strike his open palm is another youth in a blue tunic turned up with
red, and holding a spud. Behind the blindfolded youth stands a young
lady, whose flaxen locks fall from under a broad-brimmed crimson hat,
upon her shoulders over her splendid robe, the crimson ground of
which is nearly hidden by the broad diapering of gold most admirably
shown upon it.</p>

<p>In the other corner, to the right, is a lady, kerchiefed and girded
with her rustic wallet, with both hands grasping a man, who seems as
if he asked forgiveness. Overhead is a swineherd leading a pig, and
going towards a farm-labourer who is making faggots; further on is
another clown, hard at work, with his coat thrown down by him on
the ground, lopping trees; and last of all, a gentleman and lady, both
clad in the costume of the first half of the sixteenth century. These
groups on the high part of the canvas are evidently outside the subject
of the games below, and are merely passers by. All about the field are
seen grazing sheep; and to the right, a golden pheasant on the foreground
is so conspicuous as to lead to the thought that it was placed
there to tell, either the name of the noble house for which this beautifully-wrought
and nicely-designed tapestry was made, or of the artist
who worked it.</p>

<p>In a second, but much smaller pane of tapestry, the same subject is
continued. Upon the flowery banks of a narrow streamlet sit a lady
and a little boy, bathing their feet in its waters. A gentleman&mdash;a swain
for the nonce&mdash;on his bended knee, holds up triumphantly one of the
lady’s stockings over the boy’s head. Just above and striding towards
her comes another gentleman-shepherd, with both his hands outstretched
as if in wonderment, over whom we find a real churl in
the person of a shepherd playing a set of double pipes&mdash;the old French
“flahuter à deux dois”&mdash;to the no small delight of a little dog by
his side. Serving as a background to this group, we have a comfortable
homestead amid trees. Somewhat to the right and lower<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
down, over a brick arch leans a lady, to whom a gaily-dressed man
is offering money or a trinket, which he has just drawn forth from
his open <i>gipcière</i> hanging at his girdle. Below sits a lady arrayed in
a white robe, the skirts of which she has drawn and folded back upon
her lap to show her scarlet petticoat. She is listening to a huntsman
pranked out with a belt strung with little bells; falling from his girdle
hangs in front a buglehorn, and his left hand holds the leash of his dog
with a fine collar on. Over this spruce youth is an unmistakable real
field labourer with a Flemish <i>hotte?</i>, or wooden cradle, filled with chumps
and sticks, upon his back; and before him walk two dogs, one of which
carries a pack or cloth over his shoulders. Still higher up is a wind-mill,
toward which a man bearing a sack is walking.</p>

<p>In both these pieces, which are fellows, and wrought for the hangings
of the same chamber, the drawing of the figures, with the accessories
of dress, silks, and even field-flowers, is admirable, and the grouping
well managed: altogether, they are valuable links in the chain for the
study and illustration of the ancient art of tapestry.</p>

Piece</span> of Tapestry Hanging; ground, green sprinkled
with flowers, and sentence-bearing scrolls; design,
steps in a religious life, figured in five compartments.
West German, late 15th century. 12 feet by 2 feet 10 inches.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. A young well-born maiden, with a narrow wreath about her unveiled
head, and dressed in pink, is saying her prayers kneeling on the
flowery green ground, with these words traced on the scrolls twined
gracefully above her,&mdash;“Das wir Maria kindt in trew mage werden
so ... t ich myn gnade ... n af erden;” “Let us become like to
Mary’s child, (so) we shall deserve mercy on earth.”</p>

<p>2. Seated on a chair, with a book upon his lap, is an ecclesiastic, in
a white habit and black scapular. To this priest the same young lady
is making confession of her sins; and the scrolls about this group say,&mdash;“Vicht
di sunde mit ernst sonder spot so findestic Godez trew gnadt;”
“Fight against sin with earnestness and without feigning; you will
find the true mercy of God.”&mdash;“Her myn sunde vil ich ach dagen uff
das mir Gots trew moge behagen;” “Lord, I will mourn over my
sin, in order that the truth of God may comfort me.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>3. The same youthful maiden is bending over a wooden table, upon
which lies a human heart that she is handling; and the inscriptions about
her tell us the meaning of this action of hers, thus,&mdash;“Sol ich myn sund
hi leschen so musz ich ich mȳ hertz im blude wesche;” “To cleanse
away my sin here, I must wash my heart in the blood.”</p>

<p>4. We here see an altar; upon its table are a small rood or crucifix
with S. Mary and S. John, two candlesticks, having prickets for the
wax-lights, the outspread corporal cloth, upon which stands the chalice,
and under which, in front and not at the right side, lies the paten
somewhat hidden. At the foot of this altar kneels the maiden, clad in
blue, and wearing on her head a plain, closely-fitting linen cap, like that
yet occasionally worn at church in Belgium, by females of the middle
classes,&mdash;and the priest who is saying mass there is giving her Communion.
The priest’s alb is ornamented with crimson apparels on its
cuffs and lower front hem, inscribed with the word “haus,” house,
is well rendered. The inscriptions above are, as elsewhere, mutilated,
so that much of their meaning is lost; but they run thus,&mdash;“Wer he
... versorget mich mit Gottes trew das bitten ich;” “If ... not
procure me the love of God that I pray for.”&mdash;“Emphang in trewen
den waren Crist dmit dyn;” “Receive with fidelity the very Christ
in order....”</p>

<p>5. A nunnery, just outside of which stands its lady-abbess, clothed
in a white habit, black hood, and white linen wimple about her throat.
In her right hand she bears a gold crozier, from which hangs that peculiar
napkin, two of which are in this collection, Nos. <a href="#h-8279a">8279<span class="allsmcap">A</span></a>, and <a href="#h-8662">8662</a>.
Behind stands an aged nun, and, as if in the passage and seen through
the cloister windows, are two lay sisters, known as such by the black
scapular. In front of the abbess stands the young maiden dressed in
pink, with her waiting woman all in white, in attendance on her.
Upon the scrolls are these sentences,&mdash;“Dez hymels ey port Godez
vor (m)eyn husz disz ist;” “A gate of heaven&mdash;God’s and mine house
this is.”&mdash;“Kom trew Christ wol. p.. eidt nym dy Kron dy dir Got
hat bereit.”&mdash;“Come, true Christian well ... take the crown which
God has prepared for thee.”</p>

<p>Though but a poor specimen of the loom, this piece gives us
scraps of an obsolete dialect of the mediæval German, not Flemish,
language.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">
Piece</span> of Tapestry Hanging; ground, grass and flowers;
design, a German romance, divided into six compartments,
each having its own inscribed scrolls, meant to
describe the subject. South German, middle of the 15th century.
12 feet by 2 feet 6 inches.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the first compartment we see a group of horsemen, of whom
the first is a royal youth wearing a richly-jewelled crown and arrayed
in all the fashion of those days. Following him are two grooms, over
one of whose heads, but high up in the heavens, flies an eagle; and
perhaps the bird may be there to indicate the name of the large walled
city close by. Pacing on the flowery turf, the cavalcade is nearing a
castle, at the threshold of which stand an aged king and his youthful
daughter. On a scroll are the words,&mdash;“Bisg god wilkum dusig
stunt(?) grosser frayd wart uns nie kunt;” “Be right welcome for a
thousand hours; a greater joy we never knew.” Of course the coming
guest utters his acknowledgments; but the words on the scroll cannot
be made out with the exception of this broken sentence,&mdash;“Heute ich
unt ...;” “To day I and ...”</p>

<p>In the second compartment, in a room of the castle we behold the
same royal youth, wearing, as before, his crown upon his long yellow
locks, along with his three varlets. On a scroll are the words,&mdash;“Fromer
dieur bestelle mir die ros ein wagge ist nun lieber;” “Pious
servant, order me the horses, a carriage is preferred.”</p>

<p>In the third compartment is shown, and very likely in his own home,
the same young wooer talking, as it would seem by the scrolls, to his
three waiting-men; and after one of them had said,&mdash;“Wage u[=n] rosz
sint bereit als ...;” “Carriage and horses are ready as....” he
says,&mdash;“Wo schien gluck zu diser vart nie kein reise;” “If luck has
shone on this journey, I never liked travelling better.” Of the three
servants, one holds three horses, while the upper groom is presenting,
with both hands, to his royal young master a large something, apparently
ornamented with flowers; the churl wears, hanging down from his
girdle in front, an anelace or dagger, the gentleman a gay <i>gipcière</i>,
but the shoes of both are very long and pointed.</p>

<p>In the fourth compartment the same crowned youth again is seen
riding towards the castle-gate, though this time no lady fair stands at its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
threshold for the greeting; but instead, there stands with the old king a
noble youth who, to all appearances, seems to have been beforehand, in
the business of wooing and winning the young princess’s heart, with the
last comer. There are these words upon the scroll,&mdash;“Ich hab vor
einem ... gericht einer tuben und mich yr verpflicht;” “I have
before a ... tribunal of a dove, and have myself engaged to her;”
meaning that already had he himself betrothed the king’s daughter,
by swearing to her his love and truth before a dove&mdash;a thing quite
mediæval, like the vows of the swan, the peacock, and the pheasant, as
we have noticed in the Introduction, and again while treating of the
Syon Cope, at p. 28. On his side, the old king thus addresses him,&mdash;“Mich
dunckt du komst uber land ... zu der hochzeit;” “Methinks
thou comest over-land ... to see the wedding.” In this, as in other
inscriptions, the whole of the words cannot be made out.</p>

<p>The fifth compartment shows us the second and successful wooer,
dressed out in the same attire as before, but now riding a well-appointed
steed, and booted in the manner of those times. He is waited on
by a mounted page. On a scroll are the words,&mdash;“Umb sehnlichst ich
nun köme ... ist die ewige ...;” “That I most passionately now
can ... is the eternal,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the last compartment the rejected wooer is seen riding away as
he came&mdash;without a bride&mdash;followed by two grooms.</p>

<p>Though rough in its execution, this piece of tapestry is valuable
not only for its specimens of costume, like our own at the period, but
especially for its inscriptions, which betray the provincialisms belonging
to the south of Germany; and some of their expressions are said to be
even yet in daily use about the neighbourhood of Nuremberg, to which
locality we are warranted, for several reasons, in ascribing the production
of this early example of the German loom.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">
Tapestry</span> Hanging; within a narrow border of a
dark green ground, ornamented with flowers mostly
pink, and fruit-bearing branches of the vine, is figured
a subject just outside the gates of a large walled city, and upon
the flowery turf. Flemish, beginning of the 16th century,
13 feet by 11 feet 6 inches.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To all appearance the subject is taken from the Gospel of St. John,
chap. 9, where the miracle is related of our Lord giving sight to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
man born blind, who has just come back from washing in the pool
of Siloam, and is answering his neighbours who had hitherto known
him as the blind beggar. In front stands an important personage
in a tunic of cloth of gold shot light blue, over which he wears a
shorter one of fine crimson diapered in gold, having a broad jewelled
hem; of a rich gold stuff is his lofty turban. In his left hand he holds
a long wand, ending in an arrow-shaped head. At the feet of this high
functionary kneels the poor man blessed with sight, while he is taking
from him a something like a square glass bottle, and holds his coarse
hat in his hand. Near but above him stands a lady wearing a most
curious head-dress, which is blue, with two red wings bristling at its
sides. The rest of her array is exactly like, in shape and stuffs, to the
magnificent apparel of the first portly male figure, so as to lead us to
believe that she must be his wife, himself being one of the Jewish chief
priests. Talking with her is another Jew splendidly dressed, and bearing
a wand in one hand; and behind her we see a man wearing earrings,
and a woman belonging to the lower class&mdash;probably the cured man’s
father and mother. Not far away from the priest, and at his back,
are soldiers with lances, and one with a halbert, before whom
stands a well-dressed, mantled and hooded Pharisee, with a rolled-up
volume in his hand, and looking with a somewhat haughty scowl upon
the man kneeling on the ground. Above the walls are seen the domes
of several large buildings, of which one looks as if it were the temple of
Jerusalem; and all about the battlements are people gazing down upon
the scene beneath them.</p>

<p>So Flemish is the Gothic style of architecture on the gates, around
which are mock inscriptions, and on the walls of the city, that we find
at once that the tapestry must have been designed and wrought in
Flanders. Though the shapes of the dresses be for the most part quite
imaginary, still the diapering on the gorgeous cloths of gold is after the
style then in vogue and well rendered.</p>

the wind-storm raised at Juno’s request by Æolus
against the Trojan fleet on the Sicilian coast. Flemish,
17th century.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Evidently the designer of this tapestry meant to illustrate Virgil at
the beginning of his first book of the Æneid. To the left hand is seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
Boreas with a lance, which he is aiming against Neptune, in one hand,
while in the other he holds by a cord a rough wooden yoke, to which
are tied two boys floating in the water, and each with a pair of bellows,
which he is blowing. Drawn by two steeds comes Neptune with uplifted
trident, to still the winds raised by the two boys; and over his
head are Eurus and the western wind in the shape of females flying in
the air, one snapping the tall mast of one of Æneas’s ships, and the
other pouring out broad streams of water from four vases, one in each
hand. The bellows are very like those elaborately-carved ones in the
Museum, out of Soulages collection.</p>

Tapestry</span> Wall-hanging; subject, Æneas and Achates
before Dido, at Carthage. Flemish, 17th century.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The passage, in Virgil’s first book of the Æneid, descriptive of
Æneas, with the faithful Achates at his side, relating his adventures to
Dido, the Carthaginian queen, is here illustrated. The youthful princess,
enthroned beneath a cloth of estate, is listening to the Trojan
prince before her, and around are her ladies in gay costume, her own
being of light blue silk damasked with a large golden flower. As a background
we see the port filled with Æneas’s ships, to which countrymen
are driving sheep and oxen for their crews. The women are quite of
the Flemish type of fat beauty, and the odd head-dress for a man on
Achates is remarkable.</p>

from Carthage. Flemish, 17th century.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the foreground is Æneas taking leave of Dido, who is fainting
into the arms of her waiting ladies. Behind, is a youth working as a
mason and building a wall: further back, are seen horses richly caparisoned,
upon one of which rides Dido, while Mercury comes flying down
bidding Æneas to haste him away.</p>

Tapestry</span> Wall-hanging; subject, Venus appearing
to Æneas in a wood.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The second book of the Æneid has furnished the designer with the
materials for this piece. Just as Æneas had uplifted his hand to slay
Helen, Venus appears, stays his arms, and reasons with him. So says
Virgil; but here we merely see Mercury coming down from the clouds,
and Venus revealing herself to her son. The admirers of the beautiful
in form and face will not find much to please them in the lady’s person.
This piece closes the history of Æneas as given in these tapestries, which
came from the palace, or, as it used to be called, the King’s House at
Newmarket. All through, Dido is made to appear in the same kind of
costume; but the dresses in general are purely imagined by the artist,
without the slightest authority from the monuments of either Greek or
Roman antiquity: and the architectural parts are quite in the debased
classic style of the 17th century, as followed in Flanders. All these
tapestries are framed in a red border, wrought at the sides with scrolls
and shields, and below, with winged boys holding labels once showing
inscriptions (now faded) all shot with gold, but tarnished black. Many
of the female figures are slip-shod, like St. Mary Magdalen in Rubens’s
“Taking down from the Cross,” at Antwerp.</p>

afterwards. French, done at the Gobelins. 12 feet by 10 feet
6 inches. Presented by His Imperial Highness Prince Napoleon.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The subject is a startling one; being condemned to die, by the
Emperor Claudius, and put an end to his life with his own hand, Paetus
hesitated. Seeing this, his wife Arria snatched up the weapon and
plunged it to the hilt in her own bosom, and then handing the dagger
to her husband, said, “It does not pain me, Paetus.”</p>

of Westphalia, as a marriage gift. By the late Prince Jerome it was

<p>Apparently the crowded scene before us is meant to illustrate some
symbolic subject. In the midst of them all stands a queen, whose hands
are clasped. Before her kneels a man who respectfully bares his head the
while he outstretches to the princess a written paper. Behind stands a
magnificent chair. Further back is a nicely-shown interior of a room
having its cupboard loaded with vases standing on the shelves; there sit
three ladies in earnest talk. All about are groups of richly-clothed men
and women, each of whose dresses is worthy of notice.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This is one of a short series of tapestries setting forth, but sometimes
laughing at, the ideas of the ancient cynics. Before us here we
have a wild dell clothed in trees on one side, on the other piled with
rocks capped, in some places, by ruins. Seated on a stone, with a book
held in his hand, is Diogenes in meditation, with human bones, animal
skulls, and monster things about him. The work is well done, and
shows how perfect was the loom that wrought it. On a blue tablet
at top runs this inscription,&mdash;“Diogenes derisor omnium in fine
defigitur.”</p>

the waters in which he is about to wash his pot-herbs: “Sordet mihi

<p>No words are necessary to call the observer’s attention to this admirable
specimen of the French loom. Of the many fine pieces sent
forth by the manufactory of the Gobelins, this may easily take a place
among the very finest; and, at first sight, many people might be led to
think that it was the work of the pencil, and not of machinery. About
it there is a warmth and depth of mellow colouring which has partly
fled from the original, through time and, may be, want of care. Those
who have seen the pictures at the Louvre must well remember the
grand and precious original of which this is such a successful copy.</p>

Tapestry</span> Wall-hanging; design, our Lord giving
the power of the keys to St. Peter, after Raphael’s
cartoon. English (probably from Soho), 17th century.
17 feet 1 inch by 12 feet.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The point of time chosen by the great Roman painter is that indicated
by St. Matthew, xvi. 18, 19; for St. Peter holds the keys promised
him by his divine Master, at whose feet he alone, of all the apostles,
is kneeling. Behind our Lord is a large flock of sheep, as explanatory
of the pastoral power bestowed, after His uprising from the grave,
by our Saviour upon St. Peter more especially, to feed the sheep as
well as lambs in His flock, as we read in St. John, xxi. 16, 17: both
subjects are naturally connected.</p>

<p>By the many engravings, but, more particularly, the fine photographs
of the original cartoon, once at Hampton Court, now in this
Museum, this subject is well known. In this especial piece, the
colouring, being so badly graduated and garish, is by no means as good
as in the earlier one, still to be seen in the Gallery of the Tapestries at
the Vatican. Here, the tone of our Lord’s drapery is not distinguishable
from the stony hue of the wool upon the sheep behind Him.</p>

Tapestry</span> Wall-hanging; subject, Esther about to
venture into the presence of Ahasuerus. From the
Soulages Collection. Flemish, first half of the 16th
century. Height 13 feet, breadth 11 feet 6 inches.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The history, as here shown us, of a most eventful achievement, is
at top distributed into four groups, each made up of figures rather
small in stature; and at bottom, into other five clusters, in which all
the personages assume a proportion little short of life-size.</p>

<p>Beginning with those higher compartments on the piece, we find in
the two at the left-hand side the commencement of this Scriptural
record. The mighty Ahasuerus is presented to us in the second of those
two groups there, as seated amid trees, and robed as would have been
a sovereign prince during the first half of the sixteenth century. All
about his head and neck the Persian king wears, wrapped in loose folds,
a linen cloth, over which he has a large scarlet hat with an ornament
for a crown, made up of small silver shield-shaped plates, marked with
wedge-like stripes of a light blue colour, or heraldically, <i>argent</i>, five
piles <i>azure</i> meeting at the base; over his shoulders falls an unspotted
ermine cape jagged all about its edge so as to look as if meant for a
nebulée border. Upon the left breast of this sort of mantle is sewed
a little crimson shield-shaped badge marked in white seemingly with
the letter A, not having, however, the stroke through it, but above,
the sign of contraction dashed. He wears a blue tabard, is girt with
a sword, and holds in his left hand a tall wand, that golden sceptre
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
which, if not outstretched in token of clemency towards the man or
woman who had the hardihood to come unbidden to his presence,
signified that such a bold intruder, were she the queen herself, must be
put to death. Having nobles and guards about him, this monarch
of one hundred and twenty-seven provinces is handing to Haman,
one of those three princes before him, a written document from which
hang two royal seals: this is that terrible decree, which, out of spite
towards Mordecai, and hatred for the Jewish race, Haman had won
from his partial master Ahasuerus, for the slaughter, on a certain day, of
every Hebrew within the Persian empire.</p>

<p>Yet further to the left is another group, wherein we observe some
of the richly-attired functionaries of the empire. A bareheaded old
man, a royal messenger, who holds up his left hand as if to indicate he
had come from the court of Ahasuerus, delivers to one of the nobles
there this original decree to be copied out and sent in all directions
through the kingdom.</p>

<p>Looking still at top, but to the far right, we have in the background,
amid the trees, a large house, from out of the midst of which
stands up a tall red beam, the gibbet, fifty cubits high, got ready by
Haman at his wife’s and friends’ suggestion for hanging on it Mordecai.
In this foreground we behold Haman clad in a blue mantle and a rich
golden chain about his neck: to the man standing respectfully before
him, cap in hand, Haman gives the written order duly authenticated by
the two imperial seals upon it, for the execution of Mordecai. Immediately
to the left of this scene we are presented with the inside view of
a fine chamber hung with tapestry, and ornamented with tall vases, two
of which are on a shelf close by a lattice-window. In the middle of
this room is a group of three women: one of them, Esther, richly clad,
is seated and wringing her hands in great grief, as if she had learned the
fell death awaiting her uncle, and the slaughter already decreed of all
her nation: two of her gentlewomen are with her, wailing, like their
queen-mistress, the coming catastrophe.</p>

<p>Right in the centre of the piece, and occupying its most conspicuous
position, we behold the tall stately figure of a beautiful young queen,
splendidly arrayed, and wearing over the rich caul upon her head a
royal diadem. She seems to have just arisen from the magnificent
throne or rather faldstool close behind her. With both her hands
clasped in supplication, she is followed in her upward course by her train
of attendants&mdash;two ladies and a nobleman&mdash;all gaily dressed, threading
their way through as they ascend from the hall below crowded with
courtiers, men and women gossiping together in little knots, and set
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
off in fashionable dress. While bending her steps, Esther looks towards
the spot where Ahasuerus is sitting. At this moment an oldish man
steps forward, clad after a beseeming fashion: in one hand he holds
his red cap, while with the other hand he is stretching out, for Esther’s
acceptance, his inscribed roll. This person must be Mordecai, thus
shown as instructing and encouraging his niece-queen Esther in the
hazardous work of saving her people’s lives, at the same time that he
furnishes her with a copy of the decree for their utter annihilation.</p>

<p>This inner court of the King’s house where Esther is now standing
over against the hall in which Ahasuerus sits upon his throne is crowded
with courtiers, all remarkable for the elegance and costliness of their
dress. In a circle of three great personages to the right, one of those
high-born dames has brought with her her guitar, made in the form of
the calabash, to help on by her music the expected mirth and revelry
of the day.</p>

<p>In those several instances in which the royal decree is figured with
the imperial seals hanging from it, the impression stamped upon the wax
seems, no doubt, to be taken as the cipher of Ahasuerus, a large A,
but without the stroke through it.</p>

<p>One remarkable feature among the ornaments of dress assumed by
almost all the great personages in this piece of tapestry is the large-linked,
heavy golden chain about the neck, worn as much by ladies as
by gentlemen. The caps of the men are mostly square.</p>

<p>The elaborately-adorned, closely-fitting, round-shaped caul worn by
the women in this court of Ahasuerus is in strict accordance with the
female fashion abroad at the beginning of the sixteenth century; while
here, in England, the gable-headed coif found more favour than the
round with our countrywomen. Then, however, as now, ladies
loved long trains to their gowns; and the men’s shoes had that
peculiar broad toe so conspicuously marked in Hans Holbein’s cartoon
for a picture of our Henry VIII. belonging to the Duke of Devonshire,
and exhibited among the National Portraits on loan to the South
Kensington Museum, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1866.</p>

Tapestry</span> Hanging; subject, the three Fates with a
young lady lying dead at their feet. Flemish, early
16th century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>With a grove of blooming trees behind them, and upon a lawn, everywhere
sprinkled with many kinds of flowers, stand the Fates. Each of
the weird sisters may be individually known by her proper name written
in white letters near her head. Beginning from the right side of the
piece, we have the spinster Clotho, who is figured as a youthful maiden;
amid the boughs of a tree just above her is seen a long-billed bird of the
snipe-kind; she is gaily dressed in a yellow kirtle, elaborately diapered
after a flowery pattern done in green, over which she wears a gown of
deep crimson velvet, while from her girdled waist falls a large golden
chain ending in a gold pomander. In her left hand she holds a distaff,
keeping at the same time between her fingers the thread which she has
but just done spinning. Next to Clotho stands Lachesis, almost as young
in look; she is not quite so sprightly but yet as elegantly clad as her sister
with the distaff; billing and cooing above this feigned manager of individual
destiny we behold a pair of turtle-doves; this second of the
Fates is clad in robes of a light pink tone nicely and artistically diapered,
and with her left hand she takes from Clotho the thread just spun and
with her right passes it on to Atropos. This the last, and the most
dreaded of the fatal three, looks older than the other two, and is arrayed
more matronly. Clothed in deep blue, Atropos wears a large full white
kerchief, which, as its name implies, not only covers her head, but falls
well down from her shoulders half-way to her broad girdle, upon which
is slung a string of beads for prayer&mdash;a rosary. Atropos, whose
imaginary office was to cut with knife, or scissors, or a pair of shears,
the thread of life, uses no such an instrument here; for with her hands
she has broken the life-cord, and the spindle, around which it had been
wound, lies thrown upon the flowery turf close by the head of the
victim of the Fates. At the feet of these three sisters lies, stretched out
in all her fullest length, a youthful lady dead. She wears a kerchief on
her head, and over her richly-diapered pink gown she has a light
crimson mantle thickly powdered with small golden crescents. Her
bed seems made of early summer flowers; and alongside of her, and
as if just fallen from her outstretched right hand, lies the tall stalk,
snapped short off near the lower end, of a blooming white lily. At
one side, but lower down, is the half-figure of a monkey; some way to
the right, but on the same level, sits in quiet security a large brown
hare; while between these two animals, from out a hole in the ground,
as if they snuffed their future prey in the dead body, are creeping a
weasel and a stoat, just after a large toad that has crawled out before
them.</p>

<p>This piece of tapestry, valuable alike for its artistic excellence and its
good preservation, has a more than common interest about it. In all likelihood
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
it gives us the history, nay, perhaps affords us the very portraiture
of some high-born, beautiful young lady, well known and admired in
her day. A little something at least may be gathered from its symbolism.
By the heathen mythological distribution of functions among the poetic
Parcæ, or Fates, to the second of these three sisters, to Lachesis, was
it given to decide the especial destiny of each mortal the hour that she
or he was born. Now in the instance before us a pair of turtle-doves,
love’s emblem, is conspicuously shown above the head of Lachesis. As
this young lady’s life-thread slipped through her fingers Lachesis has
touched it, quickened it so that the child for whom it is being spun
shall have a heart all maidenly, but soft to the impressions of the gentle
passion&mdash;love. She has been wooed and made a bride, for she has on
the married woman’s kerchief. That lily-stem with its opening buds
and full-blown flowers at top is the emblem of a spotless whiteness, an
unstained innocence; the stalk is broken, but the flowers on it are unwithered.
What fitter tokens of a bride’s unlooked-for death, the very
morning of her marriage? But that monkey-emblem of mischief, evil,
moral ugliness, and in particular of lubricity&mdash;perhaps may mean us to
understand the worthlessness of wanton, profligate men. As the harmless
unsuspecting hare is easily snared and taken in a toil, so she might have
been caught, but may have been spared, by early death, a life of misery.
Those loathsome things coming from out the ground warn men that all
of us must one day or another become the prey of the grave, and that
youth, and innocence, and beauty will be its food.</p>

Tapestry;</span> ground crimson, diapered with foliage;
design, within a broad arch, a white panel,
figured with Diana, and about her flowers, birds,
and animals, dead and alive. At the right corner,
on the lower hem, is inscribed, “Neilson, ex. 1786.” French,
from the Gobelin factory.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Diana holds by a long blue ribbon a greyhound; below, are other
two hounds and two little naked boys, of whom one is about to dart an
arrow; the other, to shoot one from a bow at Diana herself, who, with
her shadow cast upon a cloud, is holding her favourite dog by its blue
string: at her feet lie her own bow and arrows. This piece is graciously
lent by Her Majesty, and is a favourable specimen of the Gobelins
royal manufactory, over which the Neilsons, father and son, presided,
from <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1749 till 1788. Most likely this piece was wrought by the
elder Neilson, who, as well as his son, worked with the “basse lisse,”
or low horizontal frame, as distinguished from the “haute lisse,” or
high vertical one.</p>

a well. This fancy piece is surrounded by a border figured with ornamentation,

is a good specimen of its time, and seems to have come from the same

Tapestry;</span> design, within a crimson border ornamented,
in white, with scroll-work after a classic character,
a large mythologic, perhaps Bacchanal subject.
French, 17th century.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Upheld by pilasters and columns wreathed with branches of the
vine, we see a wide entablature coloured crimson and blue, figured with
tripods, vases, and other fanciful arabesque ornamentation, and amid
these, heathen gods and goddesses, centaurs, birds, and groups of
satyrs. Below, and between the pilasters and columns, a male
figure is playing the double pipe, women are carrying fruits in
dishes, another is dancing, and some high personages feasting at a
table, with some men looking on. Lowermost of all is another
scene, in which we have little naked boys, satyrs carrying grapes, and
an ass laden with them, and other satyrs pouring into vases the red wine
which they are getting from a fountain brim full of it. A border of a
crimson ground figured in places with full-faced heads, and all over
with small figures, the draperies of which are shaded in gold now quite
black, and arabesques after a classic form, goes round the whole piece,
which is fellow to another showing the labours of Hercules, in this collection.
In the tapestry before us, all the subjects are so Bacchanalian
that we must suppose that the designer meant to set forth the ways of
the god of wine. Like the drawing in the Hercules piece, the drawing
here is good; but the piece itself is in a somewhat bad condition.</p>

Flemish, late 17th century. 21 feet 6 inches
by 16 feet.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This large piece is divided into three broad horizontal bands; on
the first of these, upon a dark blue ground, amid arabesques and monsters
after classic models, are observable the infant Hercules strangling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span>
the two serpents; in the middle, a female holding two ropes, and about
her little boys carrying tall reeds, which at top expand into a cup full of
fire, as she stands upright upon a pedestal over a doorway, in the tympanum
of which, within a round hollow, is the bust of a man having a
wine-jug on one side, and a dish filled with fire on the other; still further
to the right, there is, within an oval, a child reading at a three-legged
desk, and seated on the bending bough of a tree, at the foot of
which is a book, and a comic mask. On the second band, the ground of
which is light blue, within the doorway, coloured green, stands Hercules
cross-legged, bearing in his right hand his club, and with the left upholding
the lion-skin mantle. To the right, Hercules is seen wrestling;
next, Hercules fighting the Nemean lion with his club; and then the
hero shooting with his bow and arrows the Stymphalian birds, half human
in their shape: to the left, Hercules is beheld strangling with his own
hands the Nemean lion; then he is seen with this dead beast upon his
shoulders as he carries it to Eurystheus; and lastly, he is shown loaded
with a blue globe, marked with the signs of the zodiac, upon his back.
On the third band, which is crimson, we find Hercules, leading by a
chain the many-headed Cerberus from the lower world, having along
with him Athena, who is seen with clasped hands, and Theseus, who
is clad in armour with a reversed dart in his hand; in front lies a dead
man. The middle of this band is filled in with architectural scroll-work,
upon which are seated two half-bust winged figures, one male,
the other female, and hanging between them a shield figured with the
rape of Europa. After this central piece we come to the scene on the
journey into exile of Hercules and his wife Deianira: the centaur Nessus
is carrying the lady in his arms over the river Evenus, and while doing
so insults her, whereupon Hercules lets fly an arrow, on hearing his wife’s
screams, and shoots Nessus to the heart. The whole is enclosed within
a border of a crimson ground, figured with arabesques and heads of a
classic character. The third band has a hermes or terminal post at each
end; and, curiously enough, in the top band, and resting on the foliations,
are four nests of the pelican, billing its breast and feeding its
young ones with its blood; besides this we see in places two lions rampant,
and regularly langued <i>gules</i>, being caressed by a sort of harpy: all
of which would lead us to think that in the bird and the animals we
have the armorial charge upon the shield, and its supporters, of the
noble, but now unknown, owner for whom this piece of tapestry was
originally wrought. Its fellow-piece, figured not so much with the
triumphs as the festive joys of Bacchus, is in this collection.</p>

Tapestry</span> Wall-hanging; subject, Melchizedek
bringing bread and wine to Abram after his victory.
Flemish, late 17th century.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On a tablet at the top of the piece is this inscription:&mdash;“Sodomâ
expugnatâ Lot capitur. Abram illum recepit. Rex Melchizedek
victori Abram offert panem et vinum.” As the reader will easily
bring to mind, the subject as well as the inscription are borrowed from
the fourteenth chapter of Genesis. Supposing that Sodom, after the
overthrow by Abram’s night attack of the four kings, had been retaken,
and his nephew Lot and his substance freed from the hands of the
four conquered princes, the artist has chosen that point of time in the
story, when Melchizedek, the King of Salem and the Priest of the
Most High, went out to meet Abram as he was coming from the
slaughter; and bringing forth bread and wine, blessed him.</p>

<p>The two principal personages occupy the centre of the foreground.
Crowned as a king and wearing a costly sword, Melchizedek comes
forth with outstretched right hand to welcome Abram, from whom he
is separated by a highly ornamented tall vase full of wine. Behind this
King of Salem one of his own serving men, who carries on his shoulders
a basket full of food, is coming down the wide staircase from which his
royal master has just issued, while outside a doorway, under an upper
portico in the same palace, stand two men gazing on the scene
below them. On the other side of the vase, Abram, holding a
long staff in his right hand, is stepping forwards toward Melchizedek,
whom he salutes with his lowered left hand, and behind him a second
servant of Melchizedek has just set upon the ground a large hamper
full of flat loaves of bread. A little higher in the piece, and somewhat
to the left of this domestic, a group of soldiers are quenching their thirst
gathered about an open tun of wine, which they drink out of a wide
bowl; hastening towards the same spot, as if from an archway, flows a
stream of other military men. Amid the far-off landscape may be seen
banners flying, and beneath them all the turmoils of a battle raging at
its height. To the right, the standard-bearers and some of the vanquished
are seen in headlong flight.</p>

<p>The deep golden-grounded border is parted at bottom by classic
monstrous hermæ, male and female, each wearing a pair of wings by
its ears. The spaces between these grotesques are filled in with female<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>
figures, mostly symbolizing vices. “Violentia” is figured by a youthful
woman, who, with a sheathed sword by her side, is driving before her a
captive young man, whom she holds by the cords which tie his hands
behind him, and whom she hurries onwards by the blows from a thick
staff that she wields in her uplifted right hand. “Depredatio,” with
her fingers ending at their tips in long sharp ravenous nails, is riding
astride a lion. “Gratitudo” is a gentle young maiden, who is seated
with a bird in her lap, a stork, which she seems to be fondling. “Pugna,”
or brawling, is shown by two middle-aged women of the lower
class. With their dishevelled hair hanging all about their shoulders,
they are in the height of a fight, and the woman with a bunch of keys
hanging from her girdle has overcome the other, and is tugging at one
of her long locks. “Tyrannis” is an old haggish female with dog-like
feet, and she brandishes a sword; almost every one of the other women on
the border has, curiously enough, one foot resembling that of an animal.
In several parts of the composition besides the border, in the warp and
for shading, golden thread has been woven in, but so scantily employed,
and the gold itself of such a debased bad quality, that the metal from
being tarnished to quite a dull black tone is hardly discernible.</p>

<p>The costume, like the scenery and buildings, has nothing of an
oriental character about it, but is fashioned after an imagined classic
model.</p>

Tapestry</span> Wall-hanging; subject, the Progress of
Avarice. Flemish, middle of the 17th century.</p>

this inscription:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>Beginning at the top left hand of the subject represented, we see a
murky sort of vapour streaked by a flash of red lightning. Amid this
brownish darkness, peopled with horrid little phantoms and small fantastic
sprites, we discover a diminutive figure of Death wielding a
long-handled curiously-headed scythe.</p>

<p>Just below is a man pointing with his right hand up to Death, and
with his left hand to a little harpy before him; behind him stands a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span>
figure with two heads, one a woman’s, the other a man’s, set together
Januswise. Lower down, and of a much larger size, are three male
figures, one a youth well clad, were it not for his ragged pantaloons, the
next an old man wearing sandals and bearing in his right hand what
looks like a reliquary glazed and coloured red, while in his left he holds
two unfolded scrolls, the upper one of which is illuminated with a
building like a castle, by the side of which stands a man, over whose
head is the tau or T, with a bell hanging under it&mdash;the symbols of
St. Anthony of Egypt.</p>

<p>Beside the last personage stands the figure of a monk-like form,
clasping in both hands a pair of beads or rosary. Next we have, half
leaning from out her seat placed upon a car, and bending over an open
chest, into which she is dropping golden pieces of money from her
claw-like fingers, a female form with hideous wings and vulture feet,
such as harpies have. The chariot drawn by a wyvern-like animal,
with its fiery long tongue thrust out, has knocked down an elderly
man, who, from the tonsure on his grey head, would seem to be a priest,
and its wheel is going to crush a youth upon the ground, while the
wyvern’s outstretched claws are about to gripe a ghastly cut-off head.
Hanging on the mouldings of this car are empty money-bags, crumpled-up
deeds, and a wide-open account book. Alongside of this fiendish
hag trips a flaunting courtier; before her rides Midas with ass’s ears
to his bloated face, unkempt locks falling down its sides, a royal
diadem upon his head, and a withered branch in his hand; and, as if
bound to her chariot, walks a king, having with him his queen.
Before, but on one side, paces another crowned prince on horseback,
while full in front rides a third king carrying in his arms a naked
woman.</p>

<p>Last of all and heading, as it were, this progress of Avarice, sits a
female figure sidewise on a horse, which she has just reined up. In her
right hand she bears a red standard emblazoned with a monkey on all
fours, sharp clawed, and something which may be meant for gold pieces.</p>

<p>Flying down from the skies comes an angel, who, with his outstretched
right hand, seems to stay the march of the frightful woman
in the chariot with her kingly rout, and forbid its onward progress.</p>

<p>In the far-off landscape we discover a group of soldiers, near whom
lies stretched out on the ground a dead body, upon which an angel
gazes. Far to the right we find an open building, intended, may be,
for a church; near it are two military men in armour; inside, a third
seems holding out his hand as if he were leaving his offerings on the
altar there. Outside, and not far from this same building, may be seen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>
other four men, two of them pilgrims, of whom one kneeling before
another looks as if he were making his confession.</p>

<p>The broad border to this large piece is designed with elaborate
care. At each of the two lower corners it is figured with the one same
subject, which consists in a group of three naked winged boys or angels;
of these one holds a short-stemmed cup or chalice, from out of which
rises a host or large round altar bread, showing marked on it our Lord
hanging upon the cross, between the B. V. Mary and St. John Evangelist;
a second angel kneeling has in his hands an uplifted crown of
thorns, while lying behind him are two books; and the third angel
shows us a tablet written with the Greek letters Α Ω. All the rest of
this frame-work is filled in with flowers, fruits, birds, and snakes. Of
the flowers the most frequent are the fritillary, the rose, the lily, the
amaryllis, poppies, white campanulas, large daisies, fleurs-de-lis, and
corn-flowers. Among the fruits we see the pomegranate, of which some
are split, pears, Indian corn, apples, plums, and figs. The birds are mostly
parrots, woodpeckers, storks, cocks, doves, and some other birds of the
smaller kinds. In places may be discovered a knot of snakes coiled
about a garland made of yellow leaves.</p>

<p>The allegory of the piece is read with ease. The progress of
Avarice is headed by Wickedness, who carries aloft her blood-stained
flag, emblazoned with the monkey, the emblem of moral ugliness and
mischief. Hard upon the heels of Wickedness comes a lecherous
potentate, the type of immorality. The crowned heads, whether
mounted or on foot, that come next have for their brother-companion
Midas, the emblem of the sensual miser’s greed of gold, to remind us how
kings, nay queens too, sometimes thirst for their subjects’ wealth to
gratify their evil wishes; and the gay young man behind them, coming
by the chariot’s side, personates those courtiers who are reckless of what
they do to help their royal masters in their love for lucre. Next we are
told what harpy-avarice will not waver to execute while led on by
wicked sovereigns. Look at those about and beneath her chariot: from
them we learn that she beggars the nobility, and leaves them to walk
through the world in rags; she destroys churches, and, when lacking
other means for her fell purpose, will shed innocent blood and behead
her opponents. But here below, Avarice and those who lead her on,
though they be kings and queens, will have their day: Time will
bring them to a stand. The rifled altar will be ornamented again,
the rites of worship restored, and hospitals reopened. While an angel
from heaven stops the progress of Avarice, high up in the eastern sky
a thunder-storm is gathering; and on earth a man, whilst pointing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>
with one hand to grim Death, armed with his scythe, amid a cloud of
loathsome winged things flitting around him, with the other that same
person warns a harpy that her sister harpy Avarice will soon be overtaken;
and just as the heathen Januslike figure close by&mdash;emblem of the
past, and of a certain future&mdash;he also tells her of that just retribution
which, by the hands of Death and in another world, will be dealt out
to herself and all this miscreant company.</p>

<p>It would seem that this piece was wrought to stigmatize the
memory of some of those many wanton acts of spoliation perpetrated in
France and Belgium during the latter years of the 16th and the beginning
of the 17th centuries. Perhaps the clue to the history and import
of this fine specimen of the Flemish loom may be found all about
the person of that old man, who carries in one hand a reliquary so
conspicuously painted red, and in the other two parchment scrolls, upon
one of which we find a sort of sketch of some particular spot, with an
important edifice on it. By its size and look it seems to be some great
hospital, and from the presence there of a man having above his head
the letter tau or T and a bell hanging to it, we are given to understand
that this building belonged to some brotherhood of St. Anthony, in the
service of the sick; and that its suffering inmates were principally those
afflicted with erysipelas, a disease then, and even yet, called abroad
St. Anthony’s fire, once so pestilential that it often swept away thousands
everywhere. Near Vienne, in the South of France, stood a richly-endowed
hospital, founded <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1095, chiefly for those suffering under this direful
malady. This house belonged to and was administered by Canons
Regular of St. Anthony. The town where it stood was Didier-la-Mothe,
better known as Bourg S. Antoine. During the troubled
times in France this great wealthy hospital, here fitly represented like
a town of itself, by those lofty walls and that tall wide gateway, had
been plundered: hence, one of its brothers is shown upbraiding Avarice
for her evil doings, of which those sad tokens of moneyless purses,
well-searched rent-books, and ransacked title-deeds are still dangling
on her car. If not all, most, at least, of the persons here figured are
meant, as is probable, to be characterized as the likenesses of the very
individual victims and the victimizers portrayed upon this tapestry.</p>

Tapestry</span> Wall-hanging; subject, Abraham’s upper
servant meeting Rebecca at the spring of water.
Flemish, late 17th century.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At top, in the middle of the broad border, a tablet gives us the
following inscription:&mdash;Cumque pervenisset (servus?) ad fontem et sibi
(aquam?) petiisset et Batuelis filia Rebecca ex hydria potum dedisset et
camelis haustis et filio Abrahe eam fore conjugem oraculo cognovit.</p>

<p>In the twenty-fourth chapter of Genesis we read how Abraham in his
old age sent his eldest servant unto his own country and kindred,
thence to bring back a wife for his son Isaac; and how that man, at his
master’s behest, immediately took ten camels, carrying something of all
his lord’s goods with him, and went on to Mesopotamia, to the city of
Nahor; and how, when he had reached that place, and had made a
halt without the town near a well of water, in the evening, at the time
that women were wont to come out to draw water, he besought Heaven
that the maid to whom he should say, “Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee,
that I may drink, and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink
also&mdash;let the same be she that Thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac.”
This faithful steward had not yet ended these words within himself, and
behold Rebecca came out, the daughter of Bathuel the son of Milcha,
wife to Nahor, the brother of Abraham, and spoke and did as this servant
had wished: and then he gave her golden earrings and bracelets.</p>

<p>As was fitting, the whole scene is laid in the open air, amid a
charming landscape scattered all over with buildings. To the left, in the
foreground, we behold a maid with a pitcher getting water out of a large
square tank, ready, as it seems, for a second serving-woman to carry off,
and who is coming back with another pitcher empty to be again refilled.
In the middle ground a young woman, who carries a large pot of water
on her head, is clambering over a wooden fence, and going towards an
arch or bridge leading to a house.</p>

<p>Right in the centre of the piece stands Rebecca, with one foot resting
on a slab of veined marble, on which is placed a richly ornamented vase;
and from out another like vessel, which she holds up in both her hands,
she is giving drink to the steward Eliezer, who is respectfully bending
forwards while carrying to his lips this same pitcher to slake his thirst.
A kind of short sword, or anelace, dangles from his girdle, and a long
stout staff lies by his feet upon the ground. Two tall trees with vines<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
twining about them overshadow the spot. In the distance stand several
camels burdened; but behind him, some of his men, having unloaded
one or two of those beasts, are opening certain gaily ornamented trunks,
and looking out, no doubt, the bracelets and earrings to be afterwards
given to Rebecca. In the background are fine large buildings, fortifications,
a castle, and a palace-like erection conspicuous for its tall tower
and cupola, besides the walls of a little town.</p>

<p>The piece is framed with a very elaborately designed broad border,
containing accessories which show a strong leaning towards the ornamentation
that grew out of the classicism that burst forth at the end of the
fifteenth century all over Europe.</p>

<p>On the lower band, standing one at each side of a short pedestal, or
rather low dado, are, back to back, two bearded grotesques, each of which
is made up of a human head and face having three goats’ horns growing
out of the forehead, and of a wyvern’s body, holding aloft in one of its
claws a tall tapering torch. Further on comes a series of spaces peopled
with emblematic personages, and separated from one another by two little
naked winged boys standing on a highly elaborate zocle, and with the left
hand swinging by a cord, at each end of which hang from a ring, and done
up in bunches, fruits and flowers. In the first space is “Prudentia,”
bearing in her right hand a long-handled convex mirror, in her left,
a human skull; in the second space, upon a sort of throne, sits “Sollicitudo,”
upholding in her right hand an oblong square time-piece, while on
her left, with her elbow propped up by one arm of her chair, she leans
her head as if buried in deep thought; in the third space sits “Animi-(Probitas)”
with both her arms outstretched, as if reprovingly; in the
fourth space we have “Ceres,” the heathen goddess of corn: crowned with
a wreath of the centaurea flowers, she carries ears of wheat in her right
hand, in her left, a round flat loaf of bread; in the fifth space, “Liberalitas,”
who, from the emblems in her hands, must have been meant to
personify not generosity but freedom, for in her right hand she shows us
a hawk’s jesses, with the bells and their bewits, and on her left wrist, or,
as it should be phrased, the “fist,” the hawk itself without jesses, bells,
lunes, or tyrrits on&mdash;in fact quite free.</p>

<p>At the left side of the upright portion of the border, stands first, within
an architectural niche, “Circumspectio,” or Wariness, who, while she
gathers up with her right hand her flowing garments from hindering her
footsteps, with her left, holds an anchor upright, and carries on her wrist a
hawk with two heads, one looking behind, the other before, fit token of
keen-sightedness, which, from a knowledge of the past, strives to learn
wisdom for the future. Higher up “Adjuratio” is standing, with her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>
right hand outstretched afar, as if in warning of the awfulness of the
act, and her left hand held upon her bosom in earnest of the truth of what
she utters, whilst all about her head, as if enlightened from heaven,
shines a nimb of glory. Last of all on this side, we have “Bonus zelus,”
or Right-Earnestness, in the figure of a stout, hale husbandman, who is
about clasping within his right arm two straight uprooted saplings,
evidently apple-trees, by the fruit hanging from the wisp which binds
them at their middle height.</p>

<p>Going to the right-hand strip, we find, at the lower end, occupying her
niche, “Pudicitias,” (sic), figured as a young maiden, who holds upon her
breast with her left arm a little lamb, which, with her uplifted right hand,
and the first two fingers put out according to the Latin rite, she seems to be
blessing. In his own niche, and just overhead, we see “Requisicio,” or
Hot-wishfulness, who is shown to us under the guise of a young knight,
girt with an anelace, which hangs in front of him: in the hollow of his
left outstretched hand he carries a heart&mdash;very likely as his own&mdash;all
on fire. The last of this very curious series is “Diligentia,” as a matronly
woman, who, with one hand keeping the ample folds of her gown from
falling about her feet, carries the branch of a vine in the other hand.</p>

<p>From the quantities of dulled and blackish spaces all over the border-ground,
and amid the draperies upon the figures in this tapestry, it is
evident that much gold thread was woven into it, so that when fresh from
the loom it must have had a splendour and a richness of which at present
we can image to ourselves but a very faint idea. Though the glitter of
its golden material is gone for ever, its artistic beauty cannot ever fade.
Much gracefulness in the attitudes, several happy foreshortenings, and a
great deal of good drawing all about this design, show that the man who
made the cartoon must have deeply studied the great masters of Italy,
and, in an especial manner, those belonging to the Roman school: unfortunately,
like all of them, he too had forgot to learn what was the real
Oriental costume, and followed a classic style in dress, which, as he has
given it, is often very incorrect.</p>

Tapestry</span> Wall-hanging; subject, Tobit, the father,
sending his son to the city of Rages for the recovery
of the moneys lent to Gabael. Flemish, late 17th
century.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Sitting in the open air, we see first the elder Tobit. Well stricken
in years, and blind, he is leaning his right hand upon a staff; in his left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>
hand he holds a folded document&mdash;the note-of-hand signed by Gabael.
Thinking that he must die in a short time, he has called to his side his
well-beloved child the young Tobias, and after having given him the most
wholesome counsel for his religious and moral behaviour through life,
speaks of his own burial, and how he wishes that when his wife
Sarah’s days are done, the boy should lay his mother’s body by his father’s
in the grave. As an ending to this discourse, the elder Tobias said, “‘I
signify this to thee, that I committed ten talents to Gabael&mdash;at Rages in
Media. Seek thee a man which may go with thee, whiles I yet live&mdash;and
go and receive the money.”</p>

<p>Then Tobias going forth, found a beautiful young man, standing
girded, and as it were ready to walk; and not knowing that he was an
angel of God, he saluted him and said: “Canst thou go with me to
Rages, and knowest thou those places well?” To whom the angel
said: “I will go with thee, and I know the way well.” Then Tobias
going in told all these things to his father; and all things being ready,
Tobias bade his father and his mother farewell, and he and the angel
set out both together; and when they were departed, his mother
began to weep; and Tobias went forward, and the dog followed him.&mdash;Book
of Tobit, chapters iv. v.</p>

<p>Seated, and leaning his right hand upon his staff, the old man is outstretching
with his left to his starting son the note-of-hand to Gabael,
behind him stands his wife Sarah weeping; before him is his son, who,
leaning his long travelling staff against his shoulder, with his left hand is
about to take the important document from his father, at the same time
that he turns himself half round and points with his right hand to the
angel behind him, as if to comfort his father in the knowledge that he is
to have such a good companion for his guide. The angel, who carries
a traveller’s staff in his left hand, holds out his right towards the
young man, as telling his father and mother how carefully he would lead
him to Rages, and bring him safely home again. Last of all, and standing
beneath a tree we find a saddled ass with a large gaily ornamented pilgrim’s
wooden bottle for water hanging by its side, and the ass’s head is turned
round as if looking on the faithful dog that is lying on the ground ready to
follow his young master on the way. Magnificent buildings arise as a background
to the spot where we see old Tobit seated, and standing behind him
his weeping wife Sarah. On the threshold of their own fine house behind
them there stands in a niche the statue of Moses, who is figured with
the two horns upon his forehead, as representing the light that shone
about his face, and darted all around it in rays like horns, as he came
from Sinai a second time with tables of the law: his left hand leans upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>
those two tables that stand beside him; and on his right arm lies a long
scroll.</p>

<p>The borders all about the piece are made up of wreathed boughs of
foliage, from out of which peep forth fruits and flowers. The left-hand
strip shows a peacock perched upon the stem of a vine, and little boys
are shooting blunt-headed arrows at it: on the strip to the right, other
little boys are disporting themselves amid the branches, playing music, one
beating a drum, a second blowing the flute, others clambering up amid
the roses, fruits and flowers; one little fellow, conspicuous for his dress,
is waving a flag in great delight: on the lower border children are at
their gambols with equally graceful energy. At every one of the four corners
is a large circle, wrought in imitation of bronze, all in gold, but now
so faded that the smallest lustre from the metal is lacking. They were
figured by the means of outlines done in brown silk, each with a subject
drawn from the Book of Tobit. In the circle, at the upper left-hand
corner, we observe the young Tobias going out from his father to seek,
as he had bidden him, for some trusty guide to Gabael’s house; in
the lower round of the same side the wished-for companion, Raphael
in his angel shape, has been brought in, and is speaking with the blind
old man. Looking at the circle on the upper right-hand of the border
we see the same Tobit giving comfort to his sorrowing wife Sarah,
just as both have been left by their son gone on his journey.</p>

<p>Gold-covered thread has been much employed all about this fine
specimen of tapestry; but, like too many other instances of misapplied
economy in material, this exhibits nothing but blotches of dirty brownish
black in those laces which should have shone with gold.</p>

Transcriber's Notes
</h2>

<p>A number of typographical errors were corrected silently.</p>

<p>Cover image was created by the transcriber and is donated to the public domain.</p>

<p>Two small illustrations were recreated by the transcriber and are donated to the public domain.</p>

<p>First index entry for emblematic beasts corrected to page 140 from page 198.</p>

<p>There are two items numbered 1376. The first is probably correct as it references a matching image.</p>

<p>The poems listed under item 4456 use an unusual font which is reproduced using small capitol letters.
A sample of the image of the original is shown directly below.</p>

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
